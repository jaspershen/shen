I am now a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University School of Medicine. I am broadly interested in Metabolomics processing development, Multi-omics data integration, Biostatistics, Systems Biology, Microbiome, and Bioinformatics, and their application in healthcare.

My overarching research interests are bioinformatics algorithms (R/Python) development for multi-omics data, and their application to precision medicine. Specifically, I am interested in bioinformatics algorithm development, including 1) comprehensive analysis workflow and deep learning for LC-MS data, 2) metabolic network analysis, 3) wearable and multi-omics data integration, and 4) microbiome and metabolome data integration. I also employed the developed bioinformatics algorithms as a unique systems biology approach to study the potential biomarkers and mechanisms of 1) pregnancy and related diseases, 2) aging and related diseases, and 3) cancer. 

More tools and projects can be found in the `Projects` part.

Now I am also the member of [Stanford Chinese Postdoctral Association (SCPA)](https://scpa.netlify.app/). Fell free to let me know if you want to join us and work for the amazing community!
