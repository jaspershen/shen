I am now a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in Metabolomics, Multi-omics, Biostatistics, Systems Biology, and Bioinformatics, and their application in healthcare.

My research focuses on the development of bioinformatic algorithms and tools for large-scale metabolomics as well as its application in discovering new biomarkers related to human diseases. I have developed several algorithms and tools in the past five years. The first algorithm was [MetNormalizer](https://jaspershen.github.io/MetNormalizer/), which is a machine learning-based algorithm for data normalization and integration of large-scale metabolomics. Then I developed a web-based tool, [MetFlow](http://metflow.zhulab.cn/), aiming to provide a comprehensive pipeline for data cleaning and statistical analysis of large-scale metabolomics. The most important algorithm I have developed is called [MetDNA](http://metdna.zhulab.cn/), which is a novel algorithm for metabolite identification and dysregulated pathway analysis in untargeted metabolomics.
