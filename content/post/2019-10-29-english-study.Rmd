## Fare thee well (再会吧)

Hi everyone,

I’m excited and surprised to announce that I have accepted an offer to become the xxx at xxx. My last day at Stanford will be Friday, Nov 15.

After nearly twelve years at Stanford – the last eight in xxx – I’m filled with gratitude and pride to have been even a small part of the remarkable work you amazing people do every day. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work with so many dedicated and talented and tireless and splendid people. I’ve benefitted from your knowledge, your creativity, your patience, friendship, and faith, and I’ve received far more than I could ever repay. My endless thanks to you all.

Yours,

xxx

这封邮件是系里面的一位工作人员要离开Stanford发给大家的再见信.感觉写的非常好.值得我好好学习.
