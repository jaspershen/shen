<h2>Fare thee well (再会吧)</h2>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m excited and surprised to announce that I have accepted an offer to become the xxx at xxx. My last day at Stanford will be Friday, Nov 15.</p>
<p>After nearly twelve years at Stanford – the last eight in xxx – I’m filled with gratitude and pride to have been even a small part of the remarkable work you amazing people do every day. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work with so many dedicated and talented and tireless and splendid people. I’ve benefitted from your knowledge, your creativity, your patience, friendship, and faith, and I’ve received far more than I could ever repay. My endless thanks to you all.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>xxx</p>

<h2>November 3, 2019 Request</h2>
<p>Hi Jasper,</p>
<p>I put you on the schedule for this upcoming Sunday. I will be out of town, so please let me know as soon as possible if you are able to help out(这个用法第一次见<code>help out</code>). Remember to come by (类似于stop by) 6:30 to welcome people, and stick around (逗留) for a few minutes afterward to help any newcomers get plugged in(这个第一次见这个意思). Let me know if you have any questions! Thanks for all you do.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>xxx</p>
<p>这封邮件是一个组织的周末聚会要求我过去当志愿者的.学到的知识,包括: help out, come by, stick around, get plugged in等.</p>
