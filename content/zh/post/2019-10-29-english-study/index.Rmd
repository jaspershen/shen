## Fare thee well (再会吧)

Hi everyone,

I’m excited and surprised to announce that I have accepted an offer to become the xxx at xxx. My last day at Stanford will be Friday, Nov 15.

After nearly twelve years at Stanford – the last eight in xxx – I’m filled with gratitude and pride to have been even a small part of the remarkable work you amazing people do every day. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work with so many dedicated and talented and tireless and splendid people. I’ve benefitted from your knowledge, your creativity, your patience, friendship, and faith, and I’ve received far more than I could ever repay. My endless thanks to you all.

Yours,

xxx

这封邮件是系里面的一位工作人员要离开Stanford发给大家的再见信.感觉写的非常好.值得我好好学习.

## November 3, 2019 Request

Hi Jasper,

I put you on the schedule for this upcoming Sunday. I will be out of town, so please let me know as soon as possible if you are able to help out(这个用法第一次见`help out`). Remember to come by (类似于stop by) 6:30 to welcome people, and stick around (逗留) for a few minutes afterward to help any newcomers get plugged in(这个第一次见这个意思). Let me know if you have any questions! Thanks for all you do.

Thanks,

xxx

# Oral communication

## `A`的发音

已知分不清`A`什么时候是`æ`的发音,什么时候`e`的发音.后来问一个朋友,他说`一般`长单词是`æ`,短单词是`e`.比如"Ada",音标为`/e di e/ `,读音为[/e di e/](https://translate.google.com/?source=gtx#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=ada).而"Apple",音标为` /ˈæpl/`读音为[/ˈæpl/](https://translate.google.com/?source=gtx#view=home&op=translate&sl=en&tl=zh-CN&text=apple).
