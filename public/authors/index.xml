      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in Metabolomics, Multi-omics, Biostatistics, Systems Biology, and Bioinformatics, and their application in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on the development of bioinformatic algorithms and tools for large-scale metabolomics as well as its application in discovering new biomarkers related to human diseases. I have developed several algorithms and tools in the past five years. The first algorithm was &lt;a href=&#34;https://jaspershen.github.io/MetNormalizer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MetNormalizer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a machine learning-based algorithm for data normalization and integration of large-scale metabolomics. Then I developed a web-based tool, &lt;a href=&#34;http://metflow.zhulab.cn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MetFlow&lt;/a&gt;, aiming to provide a comprehensive pipeline for data cleaning and statistical analysis of large-scale metabolomics. The most important algorithm I have developed is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://metdna.zhulab.cn/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MetDNA&lt;/a&gt;, which is a novel algorithm for metabolite identification and dysregulated pathway analysis in untargeted metabolomics.&lt;/p&gt;
