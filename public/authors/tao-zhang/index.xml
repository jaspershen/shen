      <description>The global metabolomics profiles could clearly distinguish ESCC from HC in training data. 16 ascertained metabolites were found to be disturbed in the metabolic pathways characterized by dysregulated fatty acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer and linoleic acid metabolism. The AUC value in validation data was 0.895, with sensitivity 85.0 % and specificity 90.5 %. Good diagnostic performances were also achieved for early stage ESCC, with the values of area under the curve (AUC) 0.881 for the ESCC patients in both stage 0 and Iâ€“II. In addition, six metabolites were found to discriminate ESCC stages. Among them, three biomarkers, dodecanoic acid, LysoPA(18:1), and LysoPC(14:0), exhibited clear trend for ESCC progression.</description>
