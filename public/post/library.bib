abstract = { Systemic lupus erythematosus carries an increased risk of pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and fetal adverse outcomes. To identify the underlying molecular mechanisms, we longitudinally profiled the blood transcriptome of 92 lupus patients and 43 healthy women during pregnancy and postpartum and performed multicolor flow cytometry in a subset of them. We also profiled 25 healthy women undergoing assisted reproductive technology to monitor transcriptional changes around embryo implantation. Sustained down-regulation of multiple immune signatures, including interferon and plasma cells, was observed during healthy pregnancy. These changes appeared early after embryo implantation and were mirrored in uncomplicated lupus pregnancies. Patients with preeclampsia displayed early up-regulation of neutrophil signatures that correlated with expansion of immature neutrophils. Lupus pregnancies with fetal complications carried the highest interferon and plasma cell signatures as well as activated CD4 + T cell counts. Thus, blood immunomonitoring reveals that both healthy and uncomplicated lupus pregnancies exhibit early and sustained transcriptional modulation of lupus-related signatures, and a lack thereof associates with adverse outcomes. },

abstract = {A study combining high resolution mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry, UPLC-QTof-MS) and chemometrics for the analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from subjects with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) (n = 15) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 15) was undertaken. The huge potential of this metabolomics approach for distinguishing AD cases is underlined by the correct prediction of disease status in 94?97{\%} of cases. Predictive power was confirmed in a blind test set of 60 samples, reaching 100{\%} diagnostic accuracy. The approach also indicated compounds significantly altered in concentration following the onset of human AD. Using orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), a multivariate model was created for both modes of acquisition explaining the maximum amount of variation between sample groups (Positive Mode-R2 = 97{\%}; Q2 = 93{\%}; root mean squared error of validation (RMSEV) = 13{\%}; Negative Mode-R2 = 99{\%}; Q2 = 92{\%}; RMSEV = 15{\%}). In brain extracts, 1264 and 1457 ions of interest were detected for the different modes of acquisition (positive and negative, respectively). Incorporation of gender into the model increased predictive accuracy and decreased RMSEV values. High resolution UPLC-QTof-MS has not previously been employed to biochemically profile post-mortem brain tissue, and the novel methods described and validated herein prove its potential for making new discoveries related to the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of degenerative brain disorders.},

abstract = {Antibody Modeling Assessment II (AMA-II) provided an opportunity to benchmark RosettaAntibody on a set of 11 unpublished antibody structures. RosettaAntibody produced accurate, physically realistic models, with all framework regions and 42 of the 55 non-H3 CDR loops predicted to under an {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m. The performance is notable when modeling H3 on a homology framework, where RosettaAntibody produced the best model among all participants for four of the 11 targets, two of which were predicted with sub-{\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m accuracy. To improve RosettaAntibody, we pursued the causes of model errors. The most common limitation was template unavailability, underscoring the need for more antibody structures and/or better de novo loop methods. In some cases, better templates could have been found by considering residues outside of the CDRs. De novo CDR H3 modeling remains challenging at long loop lengths, but constraining the C-terminal end of H3 to a kinked conformation allows near-native conformations to be sampled more frequently. We also found that incorrect VL -VH orientations caused models with low H3 RMSDs to score poorly, suggesting that correct VL -VH orientations will improve discrimination between near-native and incorrect conformations. These observations will guide the future development of RosettaAntibody. Proteins 2014; 82:1611-1623. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The rapidly evolving field of metabolomics aims at a comprehensive measurement of ideally all endogenous metabolites in a cell or body fluid. It thereby provides a functional readout of the physiological state of the human body. Genetic variants that associate with changes in the homeostasis of key lipids, carbohydrates, or amino acids are not only expected to display much larger effect sizes due to their direct involvement in metabolite conversion modification, but should also provide access to the biochemical context of such variations, in particular when enzyme coding genes are concerned. To test this hypothesis, we conducted what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GWA study with metabolomics based on the quantitative measurement of 363 metabolites in serum of 284 male participants of the KORA study. We found associations of frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with considerable differences in the metabolic homeostasis of the human body, explaining up to 12{\%} of the observed variance. Using ratios of certain metabolite concentrations as a proxy for enzymatic activity, up to 28{\%} of the variance can be explained (p-values 10(-16) to 10(-21)). We identified four genetic variants in genes coding for enzymes (FADS1, LIPC, SCAD, MCAD) where the corresponding metabolic phenotype (metabotype) clearly matches the biochemical pathways in which these enzymes are active. Our results suggest that common genetic polymorphisms induce major differentiations in the metabolic make-up of the human population. This may lead to a novel approach to personalized health care based on a combination of genotyping and metabolic characterization. These genetically determined metabotypes may subscribe the risk for a certain medical phenotype, the response to a given drug treatment, or the reaction to a nutritional intervention or environmental challenge.},

abstract = {The neuroprotective role of adenosine and the deregulation of adenosine receptors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been extensively studied in recent years. However, little is known about the involvement of purine metabolism in AD. We started by analyzing gene expression in the entorhinal cortex of human controls and AD cases with whole-transcript expression arrays. Once we identified deregulation of the cluster purine metabolism, messenger RNA expression levels of 23 purine metabolism genes were analyzed with qRT-PCR in the entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex area 8, and precuneus at stages I-II, III-IV, and V-VI of Braak and Braak and controls. APRT, DGUOK, POLR3B, ENTPD3, AK5, NME1, NME3, NME5, NME7, and ENTPD2 messenger RNAs were deregulated, with regional variations, in AD cases when compared with controls. In addition, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry based metabolomics in the entorhinal cortex identified altered levels of dGMP, glycine, xanthosine, inosine diphosphate, guanine, and deoxyguanosine, all implicated in this pathway. Our results indicate stage- and region-dependent deregulation of purine metabolism in AD.},

abstract = {Metabolomics data provide unprecedented opportunities to decipher metabolic mechanisms by analyzing hundreds to thousands of metabolites. Data quality concerns and complex batch effects in metabolomics must be appropriately addressed through statistical analysis. This study developed an integrated analysis tool for metabolomics studies to streamline the complete analysis flow from initial data preprocessing to downstream association analysis. We developed Statistical Metabolomics Analysis-An R Tool (SMART), which can analyze input files with different formats, visually represent various types of data features, implement peak alignment and annotation, conduct quality control for samples and peaks, explore batch effects, and perform association analysis. A pharmacometabolomics study of antihypertensive medication was conducted and data were analyzed using SMART. Neuromedin N was identified as a metabolite significantly associated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in our metabolome-wide association analysis (p = 1.56 × 10(-4) in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with an adjustment for unknown latent groups and p = 1.02 × 10(-4) in an ANCOVA with an adjustment for hidden substructures). This endogenous neuropeptide is highly related to neurotensin and neuromedin U, which are involved in blood pressure regulation and smooth muscle contraction.

Patients with abnormal findings will be treated, in hopes that this early intervention will avoid, or delay, symptomatic disease. Google's “Baseline Study” is of similar scope and will enroll 10,000 people over 2 to 3 years. I here speculate that these approaches will likely not be effective in preventing disease, but instead, lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions. Examples from the cancer screening experience over the last 30 years are provided, which show that intensive testing may uncover indolent disease or incidental findings which, when treated, may cause more harm than good. Additional examples show that aggressive treatments for cancer and other diseases do not always lead to better patient outcomes. I conclude that the recent advances in omics provide us with unprecedented opportunities for high content clinical testing, but such testing should be used with caution to avoid the harmful consequences of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Despite the detailed rebuttals by Hood and colleagues in another commentary in BMC Medicine, time will show the actual benefits and harms of these ambitious initiatives.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Epigenetic alteration has been implicated in aging. However, the mechanism by which epigenetic change impacts aging remains to be understood. H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using Drosophila, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. We show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Amino acids, amines and other polar metabolites were profiled in baseline specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cases and controls were matched for age, body mass index and fasting glucose. Five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids had highly significant associations with future diabetes: isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. A combination of three amino acids predicted future diabetes (with a more than fivefold higher risk for individuals in top quartile).

Without the true identity of these molecules it is impossible to draw conclusions about the biological mechanisms, pathway relationships and provenance of compounds. The only way at present to address this discrepancy is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing and ranking theoretical {\{}MS/MS{\}} fragmentations from target structures to experimental tandem mass spectra {\{}(MS/MS).{\}} We compared the performance of four publicly available in silico fragmentation algorithms {\{}(MetFragCL,{\}} {\{}CFM-ID,{\}} {\{}MAGMa+{\}} and {\{}MS-FINDER){\}} that participated in the 2016 {\{}CASMI{\}} challenge.

abstract = {Herpes zoster (shingles) causes significant morbidity in immune compromised hosts and older adults. Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4+T cells yet limited CD8+T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.},

If untreated, progressive liver cirrhosis will lead to death within 2 years. Early diagnosis and operation improve the outcome significantly. Infants with neonatal hepatitis syndrome (NHS) present similar symptoms, confounding the early diagnosis of BA. The lack of noninvasive diagnostic methods to differentiate BA from NHS greatly delays the surgery of BA infants, thus deteriorating the outcome. Here we performed a metabolomics study in plasma of BA, NHS, and healthy infants using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Scores plots of orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis clearly separated BA from NHS and healthy infants. Eighteen metabolites were found to be differentially expressed between BA and NHS, among which seven (l-glutamic acid, l-ornithine, l-isoleucine, l-lysine, l-valine, l-tryptophan, and l-serine) were amino acids. The altered amino acids were quantitatively verified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the network of "Cellular Function and Maintenance, Hepatic System Development and Function, Neurological Disease" was altered most significantly. This study suggests that plasma metabolic profiling has great potential in differentiating BA from NHS, and amino acid metabolism is significantly different between the two diseases.},

Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them—STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53—can be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH.},

Here, we present iMet, a computational tool that facilitates structural annotation of metabolites not described in databases. iMet uses MS/MS spectra and the exact mass of an unknown metabolite to identify metabolites in a reference database that are structurally similar to the unknown metabolite.

abstract = {Untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling is a powerful analytical method used for broad-spectrum identification and quantification of metabolites in biofluids in human health and disease states. In this study, we exploit metabolomic profiling for cancer biomarker discovery for diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions. We envisage the result will be clinically useful since currently there are no cancer biomarkers that are accurate enough for the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions. Metabolomes of 32 malignant pleural effusions from lung cancer patients and 18 benign effusions from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were analyzed using reversed-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600. MS spectra were analyzed using XCMS, PeakView, and LipidView. Metabolome-Wide Association Study (MWAS) was performed by Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Explorer and Tester (ROCCET). Insignificant markers were filtered out using a metabolome-wide significance level (MWSL) with p-value {\textless} 2 × 10(-5) for t test. Only compounds in Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) will be used as cancer biomarkers. ROCCET analysis of ESI positive and negative MS spectra revealed free fatty acid (FFA) 18:1 (oleic acid) had the largest area-under-ROC of 0.96 (95{\%} CI = 0.87-1.00) in malignant pleural effusions. Using a ratio of FFA 18:1-to-ceramide (d18:1/16:0), the area-under-ROC was further increased to 0.99 (95{\%} CI = 0.91-1.00) with sensitivity 93.8{\%} and specificity 100.0{\%}. Using untargeted metabolomic profiling, the diagnostic cancer biomarker with the largest area-under-ROC can be determined objectively. This lipogenic phenotype could be explained by overexpression of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in cancer cells. The diagnostic performance of FFA 18:1-to-ceramide (d18:1/16:0) ratio supports its use for diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions.},

abstract = {Metabolomics answers a fundamental question in biology: How does metabolism respond to genetic, environmental or phenotypic perturbations? Combining several metabolomics assays can yield datasets for more than 800 structurally identified metabolites. However, biological interpretations of metabolic regulation in these datasets are hindered by inherent limits of pathway enrichment statistics. We have developed ChemRICH, a statistical enrichment approach that is based on chemical similarity rather than sparse biochemical knowledge annotations. ChemRICH utilizes structure similarity and chemical ontologies to map all known metabolites and name metabolic modules. Unlike pathway mapping, this strategy yields study-specific, non-overlapping sets of all identified metabolites. Subsequent enrichment statistics is superior to pathway enrichments because ChemRICH sets have a self-contained size where p-values do not rely on the size of a background database. We demonstrate ChemRICH's efficiency on a public metabolomics data set discerning the development of type 1 diabetes in a non-obese diabetic mouse model. ChemRICH is available at

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed nontargeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29 ± 4 y of age) and 15 elderly (81 ± 7 y of age) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV = SD/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found 14 blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine,N-acetyl-arginine,N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD(+), and NADP(+) Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in antioxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson's coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. Although our CV values are mostly consistent with those CVs previously published, we here report previously unidentified CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4-2.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values, such as ATP and glutathione, may be related to various diseases because their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health. Thus, human blood is a rich source of information about individual metabolic differences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The biomarker model of Alzheimer's disease postulates a dynamic sequence of amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline as an individual progresses from preclinical Alzheimer's disease to dementia. Despite supportive evidence from cross-sectional studies, verification with long-term within-individual data is needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: For this prospective cohort study, carriers of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutations (aged ≥21 years) were recruited from across the USA through referrals by physicians or from affected families. People with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP were assessed at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center every 1-2 years, between March 23, 2003, and Aug 1, 2014. We measured global cerebral amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) load using (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B PET, posterior cortical metabolism with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET, hippocampal volume (age and sex corrected) with T1-weighted MRI, verbal memory with the ten-item Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Word List Learning Delayed Recall Test, and general cognition with the Mini Mental State Examination. We estimated overall biomarker trajectories across estimated years from symptom onset using linear mixed models, and compared these estimates with cross-sectional data from cognitively normal control individuals (age 65-89 years) who were negative for amyloidosis, hypometabolism, and hippocampal atrophy. In the mutation carriers who had the longest follow-up, we examined the within-individual progression of amyloidosis, metabolism, hippocampal volume, and cognition to identify progressive within-individual changes (a significant change was defined as an increase or decrease of more than two Z scores standardised to controls).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS: 16 people with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP, aged 28-56 years, completed between two and eight assessments (a total of 83 assessments) over 2-11 years. Significant differences in mutation carriers compared with controls (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01) were detected in the following order: increased amyloidosis (7{\textperiodcentered}5 years before expected onset), decreased metabolism (at time of expected onset), decreased hippocampal volume and verbal memory (7{\textperiodcentered}5 years after expected onset), and decreased general cognition (10 years after expected onset). Among the seven participants with longest follow-up (seven or eight assessments spanning 6-11 years), three individuals had active amyloidosis without progressive neurodegeneration or cognitive decline, two amyloid-positive individuals showed progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline without further progressive amyloidosis, and two amyloid-positive individuals showed neither active amyloidosis nor progressive neurodegeneration or cognitive decline.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Our results support amyloidosis as the earliest component of the biomarker model in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Our within-individual examination suggests three sequential phases in the development of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease-active amyloidosis, a stable amyloid-positive period, and progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline-indicating that A$\beta$ accumulation is largely complete before progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline occur. These findings offer supportive evidence for efforts to target early A$\beta$ deposition for secondary prevention in individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: National Institutes of Health and Howard Hughes Medical Institute.},

abstract = {Background Recent studies in animals have shown a mechanistic link between intestinal microbial metabolism of the choline moiety in dietary phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and coronary artery disease through the production of a proatherosclerotic metabolite, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). We investigated the relationship among intestinal microbiota-dependent metabolism of dietary phosphatidylcholine, TMAO levels, and adverse cardiovascular events in humans. Methods We quantified plasma and urinary levels of TMAO and plasma choline and betaine levels by means of liquid chromatography and online tandem mass spectrometry after a phosphatidylcholine challenge (ingestion of two hard-boiled eggs and deuterium [d9]-labeled phosphatidylcholine) in healthy participants before and after the suppression of intestinal microbiota with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics. We further examined the relationship between fasting plasma levels of TMAO and incident major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) during 3 years of follow-up in 4007 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. Results Time-dependent increases in levels of both TMAO and its d9 isotopologue, as well as other choline metabolites, were detected after the phosphatidylcholine challenge. Plasma levels of TMAO were markedly suppressed after the administration of antibiotics and then reappeared after withdrawal of antibiotics. Increased plasma levels of TMAO were associated with an increased risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event (hazard ratio for highest vs. lowest TMAO quartile, 2.54; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.96 to 3.28; P{\textless}0.001). An elevated TMAO level predicted an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events after adjustment for traditional risk factors (P{\textless}0.001), as well as in lower-risk subgroups. Conclusions The production of TMAO from dietary phosphatidylcholine is dependent on metabolism by the intestinal microbiota. Increased TMAO levels are associated with an increased risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.)},

abstract = {Metabolites provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Our method is shown to improve on the competing methods for computational metabolite identification by a considerable margin.},

abstract = {Early and definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can lead to a better and more-targeted treatment and/or prevention for patients. In the diagnostic biomarkers of AD, the blood sample represents a more non-invasive, inexpensive and acceptable sources for repeated measurements than the cerebrospinal fluid. In this study, the fingerprinting metabolomics was proposed for the challenge of the blood-based diagnosis of defined AD by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HILIC/MS). These plasma samples were selected from postmortem specimens based on these pathological examinations. Firstly, we compared these HILIC columns for the non-targeted metabolic assay using pooled plasma. The principal component analysis plot of these seven columns was performed using the repeatability of these chromatograms, and can be used to visualize trends in data sets by three-dimensional dispersion, contributory standard deviation and the number of detections. Based on these results, TSK-Amide 80 and TSKgel-NH2 columns are used as a reliable HILIC/MS assay of blood-based AD metabolomics that showed metabolic profiling of the AD pathology in MS chromatograms that ranged from 1182 to 2284 compounds. A total of 54 peaks were evaluated in order to identify useful ion signal candidates using an orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis. These peaks were then specifically analyzed using the HILIC-tandem MS assay by a receiver operating characteristic curve and linear discriminant analysis for the diagnosis of the defined AD. The fingerprinting metabolomics can overcome the limitations of previous challenging blood-based diagnosis of AD, and directly evaluates the specific comparative statistical values from the raw data.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Proteomics holds promise for individualizing cancer treatment. We analyzed to what extent the proteomic landscape of human colorectal cancer (CRC) is maintained in established CRC cell lines and the utility of proteomics for predicting therapeutic responses. Methods Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on 44 CRC cell lines, compared against primary CRCs (n=95) and normal tissues (n=60), and integrated with genomic and drug sensitivity data. Results Cell lines mirrored the proteomic aberrations of primary tumors, in particular for intrinsic programs. Tumor relationships of protein expression with DNA copy number aberrations and signatures of post-transcriptional regulation were recapitulated in cell lines. The 5 proteomic subtypes previously identified in tumors were represented among cell lines. Nonetheless, systematic differences between cell line and tumor proteomes were apparent, attributable to stroma, extrinsic signaling, and growth conditions. Contribution of tumor stroma obscured signatures of DNA mismatch repair identified in cell lines with a hypermutation phenotype. Global proteomic data showed improved utility for predicting both known drug-target relationships and overall drug sensitivity as compared with genomic or transcriptomic measurements. Inhibition of targetable proteins associated with drug responses further identified corresponding synergistic or antagonistic drug combinations. Our data provide evidence for CRC proteomic subtype-specific drug responses. Conclusions Proteomes of established CRC cell line are representative of primary tumors. Proteomic data tend to exhibit improved prediction of drug sensitivity as compared with genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Our integrative proteogenomic analysis highlights the potential of proteome profiling to inform personalized cancer medicine.},

In addition to providing a variety of data processing and normalization procedures, MetaboAnalyst supports a number of data-analysis tasks using a range of univariate, multivariate, and machine-learning methods. MetaboAnalyst also offers two newly developed approaches-Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) and Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MetPA)-for metabolomic data interpretation. MSEA helps detect biologically meaningful metabolite sets that have been enriched in human metabolomic studies, while MetPA allows users to identify any metabolic pathways that have been perturbed. MetaboAnalyst enables facile interactive exploration and visualization of nearly all of its results. At the end of each session, it produces a detailed analysis report with graphical, tabular, and textual output that summarizes each analytical method used and each result generated.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease causes a progressive dementia that currently affects over 35 million individuals worldwide and is expected to affect 115 million by 2050 (ref. 1). There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies. Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease, including cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-$\beta$ levels, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and the recent use of brain amyloid imaging or inflammaging, are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming or expensive. Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but none can currently detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease with the required sensitivity and specificity. Herein, we describe our lipidomic approach to detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease in a group of cognitively normal older adults. We discovered and validated a set of ten lipids from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease within a 2-3 year timeframe with over 90{\%} accuracy. This biomarker panel, reflecting cell membrane integrity, may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.},

However, their system-level analysis has been limited owing to challenges in global metabolite identification. Most metabolite features detected by untargeted metabolomics carried out by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry cannot be uniquely identified without additional, time-consuming experiments. We report a network-based approach, prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics (PIUMet), that infers molecular pathways and components via integrative analysis of metabolite features, without requiring their identification. We demonstrated PIUMet by analyzing changes in metabolism of sphingolipids, fatty acids and steroids in a Huntington's disease model. Additionally, PIUMet enabled us to elucidate putative identities of altered metabolite features in diseased cells, and infer experimentally undetected, disease-associated metabolites and dysregulated proteins. Finally, we established PIUMet's ability for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics data with proteomics data, demonstrating that this approach elicits disease-associated metabolites and proteins that cannot be inferred by individual analysis of these data.},

abstract = {Intestinal microbiota metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine produces trimethylamine (TMA), which is further metabolized to a proatherogenic species, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). We demonstrate here that metabolism by intestinal microbiota of dietary L-carnitine, a trimethylamine abundant in red meat, also produces TMAO and accelerates atherosclerosis in mice. Omnivorous human subjects produced more TMAO than did vegans or vegetarians following ingestion of L-carnitine through a microbiota-dependent mechanism. The presence of specific bacterial taxa in human feces was associated with both plasma TMAO concentration and dietary status. Plasma L-carnitine levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation (n = 2,595) predicted increased risks for both prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and incident major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death), but only among subjects with concurrently high TMAO levels. Chronic dietary L-carnitine supplementation in mice altered cecal microbial composition, markedly enhanced synthesis of TMA and TMAO, and increased atherosclerosis, but this did not occur if intestinal microbiota was concurrently suppressed. In mice with an intact intestinal microbiota, dietary supplementation with TMAO or either carnitine or choline reduced in vivo reverse cholesterol transport. Intestinal microbiota may thus contribute to the well-established link between high levels of red meat consumption and CVD risk.},

Studies have now suggested the promising use of associations with blood metabolites as functional intermediate phenotypes in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. The aim of this study was to use lipidomics to identify a battery of plasma metabolite molecules that could predict AD patients from controls. We performed a comprehensive untargeted lipidomic analysis, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry on plasma samples from 35 AD patients, 40 elderly controls and 48 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and used multivariate analysis methods to identify metabolites associated with AD status. A combination of 10 metabolites could discriminate AD patients from controls with 79.2{\%} accuracy (81.8{\%} sensitivity, 76.9{\%} specificity and an area under curve of 0.792) in a novel test set. Six of the metabolites were identified as long chain cholesteryl esters (ChEs) and were reduced in AD (ChE 32:0, odds ratio (OR)=0.237, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.10-0.48, P=4.19E-04; ChE 34:0, OR=0.152, 95{\%} CI=0.05-0.37, P=2.90E-04; ChE 34:6, OR=0.126, 95{\%} CI=0.03-0.35, P=5.40E-04; ChE 32:4, OR=0.056, 95{\%} CI=0.01-0.24, P=6.56E-04 and ChE 33:6, OR=0.205, 95{\%} CI=0.06-0.50, P=2.21E-03, per (log2) metabolite unit).

abstract = {MetaboNexus is an interactive metabolomics data analysis platform that integrates pre-processing of raw peak data with in-depth statistical analysis and metabolite identity search. It is designed to work as a desktop appli- cation hence uploading large ﬁles to web servers is not required. This could speed up the data analysis process because server queries or queues are avoided, while ensuring security of conﬁdential clinical data on a local computer. With MetaboNexus, users can progressively start from data pre-processing, multi- and univariate ana- lysis to metabolite identity search of signiﬁcant molecular features, thereby seamlessly integrating critical steps for metabolite biomarker discovery. Data exploration can be ﬁrst performed using principal components analysis, while prediction and variable importance can be calculated using partial least squares-discriminant analysis and Random Forest. After identifying putative features from multi- and univariate analyses (e.g. t test, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test), users can seamlessly deter- mine the molecular identity of these putative features. To assist users in data interpretation, MetaboNexus also automatically generates graphical outputs, such as score plots, diagnostic plots, boxplots, receiver operating char- acteristic plots and heatmaps. The metabolite search function will match the mass spectrometric peak data to three major metabolite repositories, namely HMDB, MassBank and METLIN, using a comprehensive range of molecular adducts. Biological pathways can also be sear- ched within MetaboNexus. MetaboNexus is available with installation guide and tutorial at http://www.sph.nus.edu. sg/index.php/research-services/research-centres/ceohr/meta bonexus, and is meant for the Windows Operating System, XP and onwards (preferably on 64-bit). In summary, MetaboNexus is a desktop-based platform that seamlessly integrates the entire data analytical workﬂow and fur- ther provides the putative identities of mass spectrometric data peaks by matching them to databases.},

Toluene and methanol were the most suitable dopant and flow injection solvent, respectively. Moreover, analysis in negative mode required higher solvent and dopant flows (100µlmin(-1) and 40µlmin(-1), respectively) compared to positive mode (50µlmin(-1) and 20µlmin(-1)). Then, the optimized approach was used to elucidate metabolic alterations associated with Alzheimer׳s disease. Thereby, results confirm the increase of diacylglycerols, ceramides, ceramide-1-phosphate and free fatty acids, indicating membrane destabilization processes, and reduction of fatty acid amides and several neurotransmitters related to impairments in neuronal transmission, among others. Therefore, it could be concluded that this metabolomic tool presents a great potential for analysis of biological samples, considering its high-throughput screening capability, fast analysis and comprehensive metabolite coverage.},

Hierarchical multivariate curve resolution (H-MCR), followed by orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used for processing and classification of gas chromatography/time of flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOFMS) data characterizing human serum samples collected in a study of strenuous physical exercise. The efficiency of predictive H-MCR processing of representative sample subsets, selected by chemometric approaches, for generating high quality data was proven. Extensive model validation by means of cross-validation and external predictions verified the robustness of the extracted metabolite patterns in the data. Comparisons of extracted metabolite patterns between models emphasized the reliability of the methodology in a biological information context. Furthermore, the high predictive power in longitudinal data provided proof for the potential use in clinical diagnosis. Finally, the predictive metabolite pattern was interpreted physiologically, highlighting the biological relevance of the diagnostic pattern.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is coming of age as an important area of investigation which may help reveal answers to questions left unanswered or only partially understood from proteomic or genomic approaches. Increased knowledge of the relationship of genes and proteins to smaller biomolecules (metabolites) will advance our ability to diagnose, treat, and perhaps prevent cancer and other diseases that have eluded scientists for generations. Colorectal tumors are the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA, and the incidence is rising. Many patients present late, after the onset of symptoms, when the tumor has spread from the primary site. Once metastases have occurred, the prognosis is significantly worse. Understanding alterations in metabolic profiles that occur with tumor onset and progression could lead to better diagnostic tests as well as uncover new approaches to treat or even prevent colorectal cancer (CRC). In this review, we explore the various analytical technologies that have been applied in CRC metabolomics research and summarize all metabolites measured in CRC and integrate them into metabolic pathways. Early studies with nuclear magnetic resonance and gas-chromatographic mass spectrometry suggest that tumor cells are characterized by aerobic glycolysis, increased purine metabolism for DNA synthesis, and protein synthesis. Liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and ion mobility, each coupled with mass spectrometry, promise to advance the field and provide new insight into metabolic pathways used by cancer cells. Studies with improved technology are needed to identify better biomarkers and targets for treatment or prevention of CRC.},

We investigated metabolic alterations of acute graft rejection in human renal transplantation by applying a metabolomics approach. Sera from 11 acute graft rejection subjects and 16 nonacute graft rejection subjects were analyzed by a nontargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics approach including both hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography separations. Discriminative metabolites of acute graft rejection after transplantation were detected, including creatinine, kynurenine, uric acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, etc. The lower level of serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was found in the acute graft rejection group before transplantation. The results revealed comprehensive metabolic abnormalities in acute graft rejection. The findings are valuable for the clinic noninvasive diagnosis or therapy of acute graft rejection.},

abstract = {Antibody Modeling Assessment II (AMA-II) provided an opportunity to benchmark RosettaAntibody on a set of 11 unpublished antibody structures. RosettaAntibody produced accurate, physically realistic models, with all framework regions and 42 of the 55 non-H3 CDR loops predicted to under an {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m. The performance is notable when modeling H3 on a homology framework, where RosettaAntibody produced the best model among all participants for four of the 11 targets, two of which were predicted with sub-{\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m accuracy. To improve RosettaAntibody, we pursued the causes of model errors. The most common limitation was template unavailability, underscoring the need for more antibody structures and/or better de novo loop methods. In some cases, better templates could have been found by considering residues outside of the CDRs. De novo CDR H3 modeling remains challenging at long loop lengths, but constraining the C-terminal end of H3 to a kinked conformation allows near-native conformations to be sampled more frequently. We also found that incorrect VL -VH orientations caused models with low H3 RMSDs to score poorly, suggesting that correct VL -VH orientations will improve discrimination between near-native and incorrect conformations. These observations will guide the future development of RosettaAntibody. Proteins 2014; 82:1611-1623. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that high concentrations of fatty acids depress reperfusion recovery of ischemic rat hearts as a result of a fatty acid inhibition of glucose oxidation. In this study, we determined whether dichloroacetate, an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase, could overcome fatty acid inhibition of glucose oxidation and thereby improve mechanical recovery of hearts reperfused after a period of transient global ischemia. Isolated working rat hearts, perfused with 11 mM glucose, 1.2 mM palmitate, and 500 microU/ml insulin, were subjected to a 30-min period of no flow ischemia, followed by a 30-min period of reperfusion. Under these conditions, control hearts recovered 37{\%} of preischemic function. The addition of 1 mM dichloroacetate to the perfusate at reperfusion resulted in a significant improvement in recovery of mechanical function (to 73{\%} of preischemic function). When dichloroacetate was added before the onset of ischemia, however, this protective effect was lost, and a significant increase in myocardial lactate accumulation during ischemia was observed. The effects of dichloroacetate on glucose oxidation rates in both nonischemic and reperfused ischemic hearts was determined by perfusing hearts with 11 mM [U-14C]glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate and quantitatively collecting 14CO2 produced by the heart. In nonischemic hearts, 1 mM dichloroacetate increased steady-state glucose oxidation rates from 298 +/- 69 to 1,223 +/- 135 nmol.g dry wt-1.min-1. The addition of dichloroacetate to hearts reperfused after a 25-min period of ischemia also increased glucose oxidation rates from (112 +/- 25 to 561 +/- 83 nmol.g dry wt-1.min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This highlights the need of obtaining biomarkers to identify features that are different among mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and cognitively normal (CN) individuals.Design and methods: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)/mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to find the metabolic changes in plasma samples obtained from AD, MCI and CN individuals. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), the metabolic differences among AD, MCI and CN subjects were identified.Results: The PCA of UPLC/MS spectra indicated metabolic differences among AD, MCI and CN subjects. The peak intensities of progesterone, lysophos- phatidylcholines (LPCs), tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine in the plasma of the MCI and AD subjects were significantly different from the CN subjects. Furthermore, the peak intensities of tryptophan, LPCs, dihydrosphingosine in the plasma of the AD subjects were significantly lower compared to the MCI subjects.Conclusion: Our data provide a link between metabolite imbalance and AD, and suggest that metabolomics can be used to reveal the early disease mechanisms occurred in the progression from CN to MCI and AD.},

The molecular docking problem is to find a good conformation for docking ligand to a large receptor molecule. It can be formulated as a parameter optimization problem consisting of a scoring function and a global optimization method. Based on a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) named Fully Informed Particle Swarm (FIPS) and the semiempirical free energy force field in AutoDock 4.0, a new approach to flexible docking method called FIPSDock was implemented. The search ability and docking accuracy of FIPSDock were evaluated by multiple redocking experiments, and the results of which demonstrate that FIPS is more suitable than Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) for the force field of AutoDock. FIPSDock is superior to AutoDock and SODOCK which was also proposed by improving AutoDock with PSO in term of obtaining a lower binding energy, a better docked conformation, convergence speed and robustness. Compared with the four currently widely used methods-GOLD, DOCK, FlexX and AutoDock, FIPSDock is more accurate. Thus, FIPSDock is an efficient and accurate docking method and its promising prospects can be expected in the application to virtual screening.},

abstract = {We performed unbiased analysis of steroid-related compounds to identify novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers using liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectroscopy. The analysis revealed that desmosterol was found to be decreased in AD plasma versus controls. To precisely quantify variations in desmosterol, we established an analytical method to measure desmosterol and cholesterol. Using this LC-based method, we discovered that desmosterol and the desmosterol/cholesterol ratio are significantly decreased in AD. Finally, the validation of this assay using 109 clinical samples confirmed the decrease of desmosterol in AD as well as a change in the desmosterol/cholesterol ratio in AD. Interestingly, we could also observe a difference between mild cognitive impairment and control. In addition, the decrease of desmosterol was somewhat more significant in females. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis between controls and AD, using plasma desmosterol shows a score of 0.80, indicating a good discrimination power for this marker in the two reference populations and confirms the potential usefulness of measuring plasma desmosterol levels for diagnosing AD. Further analysis showed a significant correlation of plasma desmosterol with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Although larger sample populations will be needed to confirm this diagnostic marker sensitivity, our studies demonstrate a sensitive and accurate method of detecting plasma desmosterol concentration and suggest that plasma desmosterol could become a powerful new specific biomarker for early and easy AD diagnosis.},

abstract = {Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) pathology is a major component in the mechanisms behind Alzheimer's disease (AD). Measurement of A$\beta$(42) in cerebrospinal fluid predicts cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment and identifies AD in patients with dementia. However, studies on A$\beta$ in plasma are contradictory. In this prospective population-based study, plasma A$\beta$(42) and A$\beta$(40) were measured at baseline in 730 adults aged 70 years or older and without dementia. After five years, plasma levels were analyzed again and participants were assessed for development of dementia. During follow-up, 53 individuals (7{\%}) developed dementia of which 37 (5{\%}) were classified as AD. No difference in baseline plasma A$\beta$(42), A$\beta$(40), or A$\beta$(42)/A$\beta$(40) ratio levels were observed between converters to dementia or AD compared to the cognitively stable individuals. However, individuals with plasma A$\beta$(40) levels above the median level for the group at baseline had an increased risk of developing dementia and AD during the follow-up, even after adjustment for age, gender, APOE genotype, and educational level (odds ratio = 2.2, 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.0-4.7, p {\textless} 0.05). Neither plasma A$\beta$(42) nor the A$\beta$(42)/A$\beta$(40) ratio influenced the risk of developing dementia or AD. Moreover, A$\beta$(42) and A$\beta$(40) levels increased over the 5 years, whereas the A$\beta$(42)/A$\beta$(40) ratio decreased (p {\textless} 0.001). In conclusion, this study suggests that measurement of plasma A$\beta$ should not be used clinically to predict dementia or AD. However, plasma A$\beta$(40) may possibly be regarded as a moderate risk marker comparable to other risk markers for AD such as first-degree family history of dementia.},

abstract = {The complexity of metabolome presents a great analytical challenge for quantitative metabolite profiling, and restricts the application of metabolomics in biomarker discovery. Targeted metabolomics using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) technique has excellent capability for quantitative analysis, but suffers from the limited metabolite coverage. To address this challenge, we developed a new strategy, namely, SWATHtoMRM, which utilizes the broad coverage of SWATH-MS technology to develop high-coverage targeted metabolomics method. Specifically, SWATH-MS technique was first utilized to untargeted profile one pooled biological sample and to acquire the MS(2) spectra for all metabolites. Then, SWATHtoMRM was used to extract the large-scale MRM transitions for targeted analysis with coverage as high as 1000-2000 metabolites. Then, we demonstrated the advantages of SWATHtoMRM method in quantitative analysis such as coverage, reproducibility, sensitivity, and dynamic range. Finally, we applied our SWATHtoMRM approach to discover potential metabolite biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis. A high-coverage targeted metabolomics method with 1303 metabolites in one injection was developed to profile colorectal cancer tissues from CRC patients. A total of 20 potential metabolite biomarkers were discovered and validated for CRC diagnosis. In plasma samples from CRC patients, 17 out of 20 potential biomarkers were further validated to be associated with tumor resection, which may have a great potential in assessing the prognosis of CRC patients after tumor resection. Together, the SWATHtoMRM strategy provides a new way to develop high-coverage targeted metabolomics method, and facilitates the application of targeted metabolomics in disease biomarker discovery. The SWATHtoMRM program is freely available on the Internet ( http://www.zhulab.cn/software.php ).},

Such metabolomics studies require a careful analytical and statistical protocol. The strategy included data preprocessing, data analysis, and validation of statistical models. After several data preprocessing steps, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for finding biomarkers. To validate the found biomarkers statistically, the PLS-DA models were validated by means of a permutation test, biomarker models, and noninformative models. Univariate plots of potential biomarkers were used to obtain insight in up- or downregulation. The strategy proposed proved to be applicable for dealing with large-scale human metabolomics studies.},

Although previously tandem mass spectrometry data have been generated on the fly, the experiments described herein combine this technology with the bioinformatic resources of XCMS and METLIN. As a result of this unique integration, we can analyze large profiling datasets and simultaneously obtain structural identifications. Validation of the workflow on bacterial samples allowed the profiling on the order of a thousand metabolite features with simultaneous tandem mass spectra data acquisition. The tandem mass spectrometry data acquisition enabled automatic search and matching against the METLIN tandem mass spectrometry database, shortening the current workflow from days to hours. Overall, the autonomous approach to untargeted metabolomics provides an efficient means of metabolomic profiling, and will ultimately allow the more rapid integration of comparative analyses, metabolite identification, and data analysis at a systems biology level.},

abstract = {Nuclear fusion power delivered by magnetic-confinement tokamak reactors holds the promise of sustainable and clean energy1. The avoidance of large-scale plasma instabilities called disruptions within these reactors2,3 is one of the most pressing challenges4,5, because disruptions can halt power production and damage key components. Disruptions are particularly harmful for large burning-plasma systems such as the multibillion-dollar International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project6 currently under construction, which aims to be the first reactor that produces more power from fusion than is injected to heat the plasma. Here we present a method based on deep learning for forecasting disruptions. Our method extends considerably the capabilities of previous strategies such as first-principles-based5 and classical machine-learning7–11 approaches. In particular, it delivers reliable predictions for machines other than the one on which it was trained—a crucial requirement for future large reactors that cannot afford training disruptions. Our approach takes advantage of high-dimensional training data to boost predictive performance while also engaging supercomputing resources at the largest scale to improve accuracy and speed. Trained on experimental data from the largest tokamaks in the United States (DIII-D12) and the world (Joint European Torus, JET13), our method can also be applied to specific tasks such as prediction with long warning times: this opens up the possibility of moving from passive disruption prediction to active reactor control and optimization. These initial results illustrate the potential for deep learning to accelerate progress in fusion-energy science and, more generally, in the understanding and prediction of complex physical systems.},

abstract = {Cancer histology reflects underlying molecular processes and disease progression and contains rich phenotypic information that is predictive of patient outcomes. In this study, we show a computational approach for learning patient outcomes from digital pathology images using deep learning to combine the power of adaptive machine learning algorithms with traditional survival models. We illustrate how these survival convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) can integrate information from both histology images and genomic biomarkers into a single unified framework to predict time-to-event outcomes and show prediction accuracy that surpasses the current clinical paradigm for predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with glioma. We use statistical sampling techniques to address challenges in learning survival from histology images, including tumor heterogeneity and the need for large training cohorts. We also provide insights into the prediction mechanisms of SCNNs, using heat map visualization to show that SCNNs recognize important structures, like microvascular proliferation, that are related to prognosis and that are used by pathologists in grading. These results highlight the emerging role of deep learning in precision medicine and suggest an expanding utility for computational analysis of histology in the future practice of pathology.},

abstract = {Precision nutrition aims to prevent and manage chronic diseases by tailoring dietary interventions or recommendations to one or a combination of an individual's genetic background, metabolic profile, and environmental exposures. Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome technologies have offered opportunities as well as challenges in the use of precision nutrition to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes. Nutrigenomics studies have identified genetic variants that influence intake and metabolism of specific nutrients and predict individuals' variability in response to dietary interventions. Metabolomics has revealed metabolomic fingerprints of food and nutrient consumption and uncovered new metabolic pathways that are potentially modified by diet. Dietary interventions have been successful in altering abundance, composition, and activity of gut microbiota that are relevant for food metabolism and glycaemic control. In addition, mobile apps and wearable devices facilitate real-time assessment of dietary intake and provide feedback which can improve glycaemic control and diabetes management. By integrating these technologies with big data analytics, precision nutrition has the potential to provide personalised nutrition guidance for more effective prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Despite these technological advances, much research is needed before precision nutrition can be widely used in clinical and public health settings. Currently, the field of precision nutrition faces challenges including a lack of robust and reproducible results, the high cost of omics technologies, and methodological issues in study design as well as high-dimensional data analyses and interpretation. Evidence is needed to support the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and additional benefits of precision nutrition beyond traditional nutrition intervention approaches. Therefore, we should manage unrealistically high expectations and balance the emerging field of precision nutrition with public health nutrition strategies to improve diet quality and prevent type 2 diabetes and its complications.},

abstract = {The effects of sample preparation and chromatographic method differences on the classification and recovery of metabolic biomarkers from UPLC-MS measurements on urine samples of humans exposed to different dietary interventions have been investigated. Eight volunteers consumed three high-fat meals (rich in saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively) in randomized order with a washout period in between. For each participant, urine samples were obtained prior to and at three timed intervals after each meal. Samples were processed either by dilution (1 : 4) or by liquid-liquid extraction and then run under two different gradient conditions. For each analysis method, a total of 96 observations (eight participants, four time points, three diets) were measured. The total ion count chromatograms were analyzed using partial-least-squares discriminant analysis. All three dietary classes could be discriminated irrespective of sample preparation and chromatographic method. However, the main discriminating metabolites varied according to sample preparation, indicating that sample treatment and chromatographic conditions influence the ability to extract biomolecular information. Diluted samples showed higher m/z compounds (ca 400 u) while liquid-liquid extraction samples showed low m/z at the same retention time span. Optimized methods for metabolite identification (e.g. organic acids) were statistically inferior to global screening for mixed compound identification, confirming that multiple compound class-based metabolic profiles are likely to give superior metabonomic (diagnostic) classification, although great care has to be taken in the interpretation in relation to matrix effects.},

abstract = {Background: Post-partum depression is associated with substantial morbidity, and improved pharmacological treatment options are urgently needed. We assessed brexanolone injection (formerly SAGE-547 injection), a positive allosteric modulator of $\gamma$-aminobutyric-acid type A (GABA A ) receptors, for the treatment of moderate to severe post-partum depression. Methods: We did two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials, at 30 clinical research centres and specialised psychiatric units in the USA. Eligible women were aged 18–45 years, 6 months post partum or less at screening, with post-partum depression and a qualifying 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score (≥26 for study 1; 20–25 for study 2). Women with renal failure requiring dialysis, anaemia, known allergy to allopregnanolone or to progesterone, or medical history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive a single intravenous injection of either brexanolone 90 $\mu$g/kg per h (BRX90), brexanolone 60 $\mu$g/kg per h (BRX60), or matching placebo for 60 h in study 1, or (1:1) BRX90 or matching placebo for 60 h in study 2. Patients, the study team, site staff, and the principal investigator were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the 17-item HAM-D total score at 60 h, assessed in all patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo, had a valid HAM-D baseline assessment, and had at least one post-baseline HAM-D assessment. The safety population included all randomised patients who started infusion of study drug or placebo. Patients were followed up until day 30. The trials have been completed and are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02942004 (study 1) and NCT02942017 (study 2). Findings: Participants were enrolled between Aug 1, 2016, and Oct 19, 2017, in study 1, and between July 25, 2016, and Oct 11, 2017, in study 2. We screened 375 women simultaneously across both studies, of whom 138 were randomly assigned to receive either BRX90 (n=45), BRX60 (n=47), or placebo (n=46) in study 1, and 108 were randomly assigned to receive BRX90 (n=54) or placebo (n=54) in study 2. In study 1, at 60 h, the least-squares (LS) mean reduction in HAM-D total score from baseline was 19{\textperiodcentered}5 points (SE 1{\textperiodcentered}2) in the BRX60 group and 17{\textperiodcentered}7 points (1{\textperiodcentered}2) in the BRX90 group compared with 14{\textperiodcentered}0 points (1{\textperiodcentered}1) in the placebo group (difference −5{\textperiodcentered}5 [95{\%} CI −8{\textperiodcentered}8 to −2{\textperiodcentered}2], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0013 for the BRX60 group; −3{\textperiodcentered}7 [95{\%} CI −6{\textperiodcentered}9 to −0{\textperiodcentered}5], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0252 for the BRX90 group). In study 2, at 60 h, the LS mean reduction in HAM-D total score from baseline was 14{\textperiodcentered}6 points (SE 0{\textperiodcentered}8) in the BRX90 group compared with 12{\textperiodcentered}1 points (SE 0{\textperiodcentered}8) for the placebo group (difference −2{\textperiodcentered}5 [95{\%} CI −4{\textperiodcentered}5 to −0{\textperiodcentered}5], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0160). In study 1, 19 patients in the BRX60 group and 22 patients in the BRX90 group had adverse events compared with 22 patients in the placebo group. In study 2, 25 patients in the BRX90 group had adverse events compared with 24 patients in the placebo group. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the brexanolone groups were headache (n=7 BRX60 group and n=6 BRX90 group vs n=7 placebo group for study 1; n=9 BRX90 group vs n=6 placebo group for study 2), dizziness (n=6 BRX60 group and n=6 BRX90 group vs n=1 placebo group for study 1; n=5 BRX90 group vs n=4 placebo group for study 2), and somnolence (n=7 BRX60 group and n=2 BRX90 group vs n=3 placebo group for study 1; n=4 BRX90 group vs n=2 placebo group for study 2). In study 1, one patient in the BRX60 group had two serious adverse events (suicidal ideation and intentional overdose attempt during follow-up). In study 2, one patient in the BRX90 group had two serious adverse events (altered state of consciousness and syncope), which were considered to be treatment related. Interpretation: Administration of brexanolone injection for post-partum depression resulted in significant and clinically meaningful reductions in HAM-D total score at 60 h compared with placebo, with rapid onset of action and durable treatment response during the study period. Our results suggest that brexanolone injection is a novel therapeutic drug for post-partum depression that has the potential to improve treatment options for women with this disorder.

S-plots were used to shortlist ions of interest which were responsible for explaining the maximum amount of variation between patient groups. Metabolite database searching and pathway enrichment analysis indicated disturbances in 22 biochemical pathways, and excitingly it discovered two interlinked areas of metabolism (polyamine metabolism and L-Arginine metabolism) were differentially disrupted in this well-defined clinical cohort. The optimised untargeted HRMS methods described herein not only demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish these pathologies in human blood but also that MCI patients 'at risk' from AD could be predicted up to 2 years earlier than conventional clinical diagnosis. Blood-based metabolite profiling of plasma from memory clinic patients is a novel and feasible approach in improving MCI and AD diagnosis and, refining clinical trials through better patient stratification.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, and histopathological assessment is indispensable for its diagnosis. However, human evaluation of pathology slides cannot accurately predict patients' prognoses. In this study, we obtain 2,186 haematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology whole-slide images of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 294 additional images from Stanford Tissue Microarray (TMA) Database. We extract 9,879 quantitative image features and use regularized machine-learning methods to select the top features and to distinguish shorter-term survivors from longer-term survivors with stage I adenocarcinoma (P{\textless}0.003) or squamous cell carcinoma (P=0.023) in the TCGA data set. We validate the survival prediction framework with the TMA cohort (P{\textless}0.036 for both tumour types). Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can predict the prognosis of lung cancer patients and thereby contribute to precision oncology. Our methods are extensible to histopathology images of other organs.},

Comprehensive and well-annotated MS-based spectral databases play a key role in serving this purpose via the formation of metabolite annotations. The main characteristics of the mass spectral databases currently used in MS-based metabolomics are reviewed in this study, underlining their advantages and limitations. In addition, the overlap of compounds with MSn(n ≥ 2) spectra from authentic chemical standards in most public and commercial databases has been calculated for the first time.

Fundamentally, it provides information on the universal outcome of influencing factors on disease states and has great potential in the early diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and understanding of the pathogenesis of disease. Diseases, such as diabetes, with a complex set of interactions between genetic and environmental factors, produce changes in the body's biochemical profile, thereby providing potential markers for diagnosis and initiation of therapies. There is clearly a need to discover new ways to aid diagnosis and assessment of glycemic status to help reduce diabetes complications and improve the quality of life. Many factors, including peptides, proteins, metabolites, nucleic acids, and polymorphisms, have been proposed as putative biomarkers for diabetes.Metabolomics is an approach used to identify and assessmetabolic characteristics, changes, and phenotypes in response to influencing factors, such as environment, diet, lifestyle, and pathophysiological states. The specificity and sensitivity using metabolomics to identify biomarkers of disease have become increasingly feasible because of advances in analytical and information technologies. Likewise, the emergence of high-throughput genotyping technologies and genome-wide association studies has prompted the search for genetic markers of diabetes predisposition or susceptibility. In this review, we consider the application of key metabolomic and genomic methodologies in diabetes and summarize the established, new, and emerging metabolomic and genomic biomarkers for the disease. We conclude by summarizing future insights into the search for improved biomarkers for diabetes research and human diagnostics. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.},

We report a network-based approach, prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics (PIUMet), that infers molecular pathways and components via integrative analysis of metabolite features, without requiring their identification. We demonstrated PIUMet by analyzing changes in metabolism of sphingolipids, fatty acids and steroids in a Huntington's disease model. Additionally, PIUMet enabled us to elucidate putative identities of altered metabolite features in diseased cells, and infer experimentally undetected, disease-associated metabolites and dysregulated proteins. Finally, we established PIUMet's ability for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics data with proteomics data, demonstrating that this approach elicits disease-associated metabolites and proteins that cannot be inferred by individual analysis of these data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry has become the analytical method of choice in metabolomics research. The identification of unknown compounds is the main bottleneck. In addition to the precursor mass, tandem MS spectra carry informative fragment peaks, but the coverage of spectral libraries of measured reference compounds are far from covering the complete chemical space. Compound libraries such as PubChem or KEGG describe a larger number of compounds, which can be used to compare their in silico fragmentation with spectra of unknown metabolites.RESULTS: We created the MetFrag suite to obtain a candidate list from compound libraries based on the precursor mass, subsequently ranked by the agreement between measured and in silico fragments. In the evaluation MetFrag was able to rank most of the correct compounds within the top 3 candidates returned by an exact mass query in KEGG. Compared to a previously published study, MetFrag obtained better results than the commercial MassFrontier software. Especially for large compound libraries, the candidates with a good score show a high structural similarity or just different stereochemistry, a subsequent clustering based on chemical distances reduces this redundancy. The in silico fragmentation requires less than a second to process a molecule, and MetFrag performs a search in KEGG or PubChem on average within 30 to 300 seconds, respectively, on an average desktop PC.CONCLUSIONS: We presented a method that is able to identify small molecules from tandem MS measurements, even without spectral reference data or a large set of fragmentation rules. With today's massive general purpose compound libraries we obtain dozens of very similar candidates, which still allows a confident estimate of the correct compound class. Our tool MetFrag improves the identification of unknown substances from tandem MS spectra and delivers better results than comparable commercial software. MetFrag is available through a web application, web services and as java library. The web frontend allows the end-user to analyse single spectra and browse the results, whereas the web service and console application are aimed to perform batch searches and evaluation},

Thus, important metabolic pathways involved in neurodegeneration could be studied on the basis of these perturbations, such as membrane breakdown (phospholipids and diacylglycerols), oxidative stress (prostaglandins, imidazole and histidine), alterations in neurotransmission systems (oleamide and putrescine) and hyperammonaemia (guanidine and arginine). Moreover, it is noteworthy that some of these potential biomarkers have not been previously described for Alzheimer's disease.},

Information from the target chromatographic profiles was used to determine the standard profile as a reference for alignment. A novel, piecewise data partition strategy was applied for the determination of the target components in the standard profile as markers for alignment. An automated target search (ATS) method was proposed to find the exact retention times of the selected targets in other profiles for alignment. The linear interpolation technique (LIT) was employed to align the profiles prior to pattern recognition, comprehensive comparison analysis, and other data processing steps. In total, 94 metabolite profiles of ginseng were studied, including the most volatile secondary metabolites.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolomics experiments often comprise large numbers of biological samples resulting in huge amounts of data. This data needs to be inspected for plausibility before data evaluation to detect putative sources of error e.g. retention time or mass accuracy shifts. Especially in liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) based metabolomics research, proper quality control checks (e.g. for precision, signal drifts or offsets) are crucial prerequisites to achieve reliable and comparable results within and across experimental measurement sequences. Software tools can support this process.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The software tool QCScreen was developed to offer a quick and easy data quality check of LC-HRMS derived data. It allows a flexible investigation and comparison of basic quality-related parameters within user-defined target features and the possibility to automatically evaluate multiple sample types within or across different measurement sequences in a short time. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows an easy selection of processing steps and parameter settings. The generated results include a coloured overview plot of data quality across all analysed samples and targets and, in addition, detailed illustrations of the stability and precision of the chromatographic separation, the mass accuracy and the detector sensitivity. The use of QCScreen is demonstrated with experimental data from metabolomics experiments using selected standard compounds in pure solvent. The application of the software identified problematic features, samples and analytical parameters and suggested which data files or compounds required closer manual inspection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: QCScreen is an open source software tool which provides a useful basis for assessing the suitability of LC-HRMS data prior to time consuming, detailed data processing and subsequent statistical analysis. It accepts the generic mzXML format and thus can be used with many different LC-HRMS platforms to process both multiple quality control sample types as well as experimental samples in one or more measurement sequences.},

@article{Gika2007,
abstract = {Self-evidently, research in areas supporting "systems biology" such as genomics, proteomics, and metabonomics are critically dependent on the generation of sound analytical data. Metabolic phenotyping using LC-MS-based methods is currently at a relatively early stage of development, and approaches to ensure data quality are still developing. As part of studies on the application of LC-MS in metabonomics, the within-day reproducibility of LC-MS, with both positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI), has been investigated using a standard "quality control" (QC) sample. The results showed that the first few injections on the system were not representative, and should be discarded, and that reproducibility was critically dependent on signal intensity. On the basis of these findings, an analytical protocol for the metabonomic analysis of human urine has been developed with proposed acceptance criteria based on a step-by-step assessment of the data. Short-term sample stability for human urine was also assessed. Samples were stable for at least 20 h at 4 degrees C in the autosampler while queuing for analysis. Samples stored at either -20 or -80 degrees C for up to 1 month were indistinguishable on subsequent LC-MS analysis. Overall, by careful monitoring of the QC data, it is possible to demonstrate that the "within-day" reproducibility of LC-MS is sufficient to ensure data quality in global metabolic profiling applications.

The DiscovEHR collaboration between the Regeneron Genetics Center and Geisinger Health System couples high-throughput sequencing to an integrated health care system using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). We sequenced the exomes of 50,726 adult participants in the DiscovEHR study to identify ∼4.2 million rare single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events, of which ∼176,000 are predicted to result in a loss of gene function. Linking these data to EHR-derived clinical phenotypes, we find clinical associations supporting therapeutic targets, including genes encoding drug targets for lipid lowering, and identify previously unidentified rare alleles associated with lipid levels and other blood level traits. About 3.5{\%} of individuals harbor deleterious variants in 76 clinically actionable genes.

Standard semi-quantitative scoring approaches, however, are coarse-grained and can lack precise neuroanatomic localization.

Using automated segmentation of stained objects and a cloud-based interface, we annotated {\textgreater}70,000 plaque candidates from 43 whole slide images (WSIs) to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. Networks achieved strong plaque classification (0.993 and 0.744 areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve, respectively) on a 10 WSI hold-out set. Prediction confidence maps visualized morphology distributions from the full-WSI level down to 20x magnification. Resulting plaque-burden scores correlated well with established semi-quantitative scores. Finally, saliency mapping demonstrated that networks learned patterns agreeing with accepted pathologic features. This scalable means to augment a neuropathologist's ability may suggest a route to neuropathologic deep phenotyping.},

abstract = {Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health care. Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.},

Apparent missingness can be due to true absence of the metabolite in the sample or presence at a level below detectability. Mixture-model analysis can formally account for metabolite ‘missingness' due to absence or undetectability, but software for this type of analysis in the high-throughput setting is limited. The R package metabomxtr has been developed to facilitate mixture-model analysis of non-targeted metabolomics data in which only a portion of samples have quantifiable abundance for certain metabolites.$\backslash$nAvailability and implementation: metabomxtr is available through Bioconductor.

abstract = {Data collected from omics technologies have revealed pervasive heterogeneity and stochasticity of molecular states within and between phenotypes. A prominent example of such heterogeneity occurs between genome-wide mRNA, microRNA, and methylation profiles from one individual tumor to another, even within a cancer subtype. However, current methods in bioinformatics, such as detecting differentially expressed genes or CpG sites, are population-based and therefore do not effectively model intersample diversity. Here we introduce a unified theory to quantify sample-level heterogeneity that is applicable to a single omics profile. Specifically, we simplify an omics profile to a digital representation based on the omics profiles from a set of samples from a reference or baseline population (e.g., normal tissues). The state of any subprofile (e.g., expression vector for a subset of genes) is said to be “divergent” if it lies outside the estimated support of the baseline distribution and is consequently interpreted as “dysregulated” relative to that baseline. We focus on two cases: single features (e.g., individual genes) and distinguished subsets (e.g., regulatory pathways). Notably, since the divergence analysis is at the individual sample level, dysregulation can be analyzed probabilistically; for example, one can estimate the probability that a gene or pathway is divergent in some population. Finally, the reduction in complexity facilitates a more “personalized” and biologically interpretable analysis of variation, as illustrated by experiments involving tissue characterization, disease detection and progression, and disease–pathway associations.},

abstract = {Screening tests for Alzheimer's disease lack sensitivity and specificity. We developed the AD8, a brief dementia screening interview validated against clinical and cognitive evaluations, as an improvement over current screening methods. Because insufficient follow-up has occurred to validate the AD8 against the neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer's disease, we investigated whether AD8 scores correspond to impairment in episodic memory testing and changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B) characteristic of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We also compared informant-based assessments with brief performance-based dementia screening measurements such as the Mini Mental State Exam. The sample (n = 257) had a mean age of 75.4 years with 15.1 years of education; 88.7{\%} were Caucasian and 45.5{\%} were male. The sample was divided into two groups based on their AD8 scores: those with a negative dementia screening test (AD8 score 0 or 1, n = 137) and those with a positive dementia screening test (AD8 score ≥2, n = 120). Individuals with positive AD8 scores had abnormal Pittsburgh compound B binding (P {\textless} 0.001) and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with individuals with negative AD8 scores. Individuals with positive AD8 tests and positive biomarkers scored in the impaired range on the Wechsler Logical Memory Story A (mean score 7.0 ± 4.5 for Pittsburgh compound B; mean score 7.6 ± 5.3 for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein 1-42). The AD8 area under the curve for Pittsburgh compound B was 0.737 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.64-0.83) and for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta protein 1-42 was 0.685 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.60-0.77) suggesting good discrimination. The AD8 had superior sensitivity in detecting early stages of dementia compared with the Mini Mental State Examination. The AD8 had a likelihood ratio of a positive test of 5.8 (95{\%} confidence interval: 5.4-6.3) and likelihood ratio of a negative test of 0.04 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.03-0.06), increasing the pre-test probability of an individual having symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Individuals with AD8 scores of ≥2 had a biomarker phenotype consistent with Alzheimer's disease and lower performance on episodic memory tests, supporting a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Informant-based assessments may be superior to performance-based screening measures such as the Mini Mental State Examination in corresponding to underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology, particularly at the earliest stages of decline. The use of a brief test such as the AD8 may improve strategies for detecting dementia in community settings where biomarkers may not be readily available, and may enrich clinical trial recruitment by increasing the likelihood that participants have underlying biomarker abnormalities.},

abstract = {Identification of metabolites in non-targeted metabolomics continues to be a bottleneck in metabolomics studies in large human cohorts. Unidentified metabolites frequently emerge in the results of association studies linking metabolite levels to, for example, clinical phenotypes. For further analyses these unknown metabolites must be identified. Current approaches utilize chemical information, such as spectral details and fragmentation characteristics to determine components of unknown metabolites. Here, we propose a systems biology model exploiting the internal correlation structure of metabolite levels in combination with existing biochemical and genetic information to characterize properties of unknown molecules. Levels of 758 metabolites (439 known, 319 unknown) in human blood samples of 2279 subjects were measured using a non-targeted metabolomics platform (LC–MS and GC–MS). We reconstructed the structure of biochemical pathways that are imprinted in these metabolomics data by building an empirical network model based on 1040 significant partial correlations between metabolites. We further added associations of these metabolites to 134 genes from genome-wide association studies as well as reactions and functional relations to genes from the public database Recon 2 to the network model. From the local neighborhood in the network, we were able to predict the pathway annotation of 180 unknown metabolites. Furthermore, we classified 100 pairs of known and unknown and 45 pairs of unknown metabolites to 21 types of reactions based on their mass differences. As a proof of concept, we then looked further into the special case of predicted dehydrogenation reactions leading us to the selection of 39 candidate molecules for 5 unknown metabolites. Finally, we could verify 2 of those candidates by applying LC–MS analyses of commercially available candidate substances.

abstract = {Background: We investigated the potential of proteomic fingerprinting with mass spectrometric serum profiling, coupled with pattern recognition methods, to identify biomarkers that could improve diagnosis of tuberculosis. Methods: We obtained serum proteomic profiles from patients with active tuberculosis and controls by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry. A supervised machine-learning approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) was used to obtain a classifier that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets. We used k-fold cross validation and random sampling of the SVM classifier to assess the classifier further. Relevant mass peaks were selected by correlational analysis and assessed with SVM. We tested the diagnostic potential of candidate biomarkers, identified by peptide mass fingerprinting, by conventional immunoassays and SVM classifiers trained on these data. Findings: Our SVM classifier discriminated the proteomic profile of patients with active tuberculosis from that of controls with overlapping clinical features. Diagnostic accuracy was 94{\%} (sensitivity 93{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}, specificity 94{\textperiodcentered}9{\%}) for patients with tuberculosis and was unaffected by HIV status. A classifier trained on the 20 most informative peaks achieved diagnostic accuracy of 90{\%}. From these peaks, two peptides (serum amyloid A protein and transthyretin) were identified and quantitated by immunoassay. Because these peptides reflect inflammatory states, we also quantitated neopterin and C reactive protein. Application of an SVM classifier using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84{\%} for tuberculosis. Validation on a second, prospectively collected testing set gave similar accuracies using the whole proteomic signature and the 20 selected peaks. Using combinations of the four biomarkers, we achieved diagnostic accuracies of up to 78{\%}. Interpretation: The potential biomarkers for tuberculosis that we identified through proteomic fingerprinting and pattern recognition have a plausible biological connection with the disease and could be used to develop new diagnostic tests. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The rapid development of high throughput biotechnologies has led to an onslaught of data describing genetic perturbations and changes in mRNA and protein levels in the cell. Because each assay provides a one-dimensional snapshot of active signaling pathways, it has become desirable to perform multiple assays (e.g. mRNA expression and phospho-proteomics) to measure a single condition. However, as experiments expand to accommodate various cellular conditions, proper analysis and interpretation of these data have become more challenging. Here we introduce a novel approach called SAMNet, for Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Networks, that is able to interpret diverse assays over multiple perturbations. The algorithm uses a constrained optimization approach to integrate mRNA expression data with upstream genes, selecting edges in the protein-protein interaction network that best explain the changes across all perturbations. The result is a putative set of protein interactions that succinctly summarizes the results from all experiments, highlighting the network elements unique to each perturbation. We evaluated SAMNet in both yeast and human datasets. The yeast dataset measured the cellular response to seven different transition metals, and the human dataset measured cellular changes in four different lung cancer models of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a crucial process in tumor metastasis. SAMNet was able to identify canonical yeast metal-processing genes unique to each commodity in the yeast dataset, as well as human genes such as $\beta$-catenin and TCF7L2/TCF4 that are required for EMT signaling but escaped detection in the mRNA and phospho-proteomic data. Moreover, SAMNet also highlighted drugs likely to modulate EMT, identifying a series of less canonical genes known to be affected by the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec), suggesting a possible influence of this drug on EMT.},

At the earliest stages of AD, no significant cognitive or functional impairment is detected by conventional clinical methods. However, new technologies based on structural and functional neuroimaging, and on the biochemical analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reveal correlates of intracerebral pathology in individuals with mild, predementia symptoms. These putative correlates are commonly referred to as AD-related biomarkers. The relevance of the early diagnosis of AD relies on the hypothesis that pharmacological interventions with disease-modifying compounds are likely to produce clinically relevant benefits if started early enough in the continuum towards dementia. Here we review the clinical characteristics of the prodromal and transitional states from normal cognitive ageing to dementia in AD. We further address recent developments in biomarker research to support the early diagnosis and prediction of dementia, and point out the challenges and perspectives for the translation of research data into clinical practice.},

In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80{\%} of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.},

The ACVD gut microbiome deviates from the healthy status by increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. and, functionally, in the potential for metabolism or transport of several molecules important for cardiovascular health. Although drug treatment represents a confounding factor, ACVD status, and not current drug use, is the major distinguishing feature in this cohort.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the brain and is the most common form of dementia. To-date no simple, inexpensive and minimally invasive procedure is available to confirm with certainty the early diagnosis of AD prior to the manifestations of symptoms characteristic of the disease. Therefore, if population screening of individuals is to be performed, more suitable, easily accessible tissues would need to be used for a diagnostic test that would identify those who exhibit cellular pathology indicative of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD risk so that they can be prioritized for primary prevention. This need for minimally invasive tests could be achieved by target-ing surrogate tissues, since it is now well recognized that AD is not only a disorder restricted to pathology and biomarkers within the brain. Human buccal cells for instance are accessible in a minimally invasive manner, and exhibit cytological and nuclear morphologies that may be indicative of accelerated ageing or neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. How-ever, to our knowledge there is no review available in the literature covering the biology of buccal cells and their applica-tions in AD biomarker research. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize some of the main findings of biomark-ers reported for AD in peripheral tissues, with a further focus on the rationale for the use of the buccal mucosa (BM) for biomarkers of AD and the evidence to date of changes exhibited in buccal cells with AD.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Epigenetic alteration has been implicated in aging. However, the mechanism by which epigenetic change impacts aging remains to be understood. H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using Drosophila, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. We show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Because of a limited volume of urine that can be collected from a mouse, it is very difficult to apply the common strategy of using multiple analytical techniques to analyze the metabolites to increase the metabolome coverage for mouse urine metabolomics. We report an enabling method based on differential isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for relative quantification of over 950 putative metabolites using 20 $\mu$L of urine as the starting material. The workflow involves aliquoting 10 $\mu$L of an individual urine sample for ¹²C-dansylation labeling that target amines and phenols. Another 10 $\mu$L of aliquot was taken from each sample to generate a pooled sample that was subjected to ¹³C-dansylation labeling. The ¹²C-labeled individual sample was mixed with an equal volume of the ¹³C-labeled pooled sample. The mixture was then analyzed by LC-MS to generate information on metabolite concentration differences among different individual samples. The interday repeatability for the LC-MS runs was assessed, and the median relative standard deviation over 4 days was 5.0{\%}. This workflow was then applied to a metabolomic biomarker discovery study using urine samples obtained from the TgCRND8 mouse model of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) throughout the course of their pathological deposition of beta amyloid (A$\beta$). It was showed that there was a distinct metabolomic separation between the AD prone mice and the wild type (control) group. As early as 15-17 weeks of age (presymptomatic), metabolomic differences were observed between the two groups, and after the age of 25 weeks the metabolomic alterations became more pronounced. The metabolomic changes at different ages corroborated well with the phenotype changes in this transgenic mice model. Several useful candidate biomarkers including methionine, desaminotyrosine, taurine, N1-acetylspermidine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were identified. Some of them were found in previous metabolomics studies in human cerebrospinal fluid or blood samples. This work illustrates the utility of this isotope labeling LC-MS method for biomarker discovery using mouse urine metabolomics.},

Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography has been shown to reduce mortality by 20–43{\%} and is now included in US screening guidelines1–6. Existing challenges include inter-grader variability and high false-positive and false-negative rates7–10. We propose a deep learning algorithm that uses a patient's current and prior computed tomography volumes to predict the risk of lung cancer. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art performance (94.4{\%} area under the curve) on 6,716 National Lung Cancer Screening Trial cases, and performs similarly on an independent clinical validation set of 1,139 cases. We conducted two reader studies. When prior computed tomography imaging was not available, our model outperformed all six radiologists with absolute reductions of 11{\%} in false positives and 5{\%} in false negatives. Where prior computed tomography imaging was available, the model performance was on-par with the same radiologists. This creates an opportunity to optimize the screening process via computer assistance and automation. While the vast majority of patients remain unscreened, we show the potential for deep learning models to increase the accuracy, consistency and adoption of lung cancer screening worldwide.},

The number of MS2 spectra that can be collected during a metabolomic profiling experiment far outweigh the amount of time required for pain-staking manual interpretation; therefore, a degree of software workflow autonomy is required for broad-scale metabolite annotation.

abstract = {Electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is a routine technique for identifying and quantifying compounds in complex mixtures. The identification step can be aided by matching acquired tandem mass spectra (MS(2)) against reference library spectra as is routine for electron ionization (EI) spectra from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). However, unlike the latter spectra, ESI MS(2) spectra are likely to originate from various precursor ions for a given target molecule and may be acquired at varying energies and resolutions and have characteristic noise signatures, requiring processing methods very different from EI to obtain complete and high quality reference spectra for individual analytes. This paper presents procedures developed for creating a tandem mass spectral library that addresses these factors. Library building begins by acquiring MS(2) spectra for all major MS(1) peaks in an infusion run, followed by assigning MS(2) spectra to clusters and creating a consensus spectrum for each. Intensity-based constraints for cluster membership were developed, as well as peak testing to recognize and eliminate suspect peaks and reduce noise. Consensus spectra were then examined by a human evaluator using a number of criteria, including a fraction of annotated peaks and consistency of spectra for a given ion at different energies. These methods have been developed and used to build a library from {\textgreater}9000 compounds, yielding 230,000 spectra.},

However, the use of GC--EI MS in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex datasets characterized by co-eluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information of metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce eRah, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of GC--MS chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance (CMLC) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (i...},

abstract = {A number of metabolic conditions, including hypoglycemia, high blood pressure (HBP), dyslipidemia, nerve damage and amputation, and vision problems, occur as a result of uncontrolled blood glucose levels over a prolonged period of time. The different components of diabetic complications are not independent but rather interdependent of each other, rendering the disease difficult to diagnose and control. The underlying pathogenesis of those components cannot be easily elucidated because of the heterogeneous, polygenic, and multifactorial nature of the disease. Metabonomics offers a snapshot of distinct biochemical variations that may reflect the unique metabolic phenotype under pathophysiological conditions. Here we report a mass-spectrometry-based metabonomic study designed to identify the distinct metabolic changes associated with several complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 292 patients recruited in the study were divided into five groups, including T2DM with HBP, T2DM with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), T2DM with HBP and NAFLD, T2DM with HBP and coronary heart disease (CHD), and T2DM with HBP, NAFLD, and CHD. Serum differential metabolites were identified in each group of T2DM complication, mainly involving bile acid, fatty acid, amino acid, lipid, carbohydrate, steroids metabolism, and tricarboxylic acids cycle. These broad-spectrum metabolic changes emphasize the complex abnormalities present among these complications with elevated blood glucose levels, providing a novel strategy for stratifying patients with T2DM complications using blood-based metabolite markers.},

abstract = {Automated breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images plays a key role in computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Breast cancer multi-classification is to identify subordinate classes of breast cancer (Ductal carcinoma, Fibroadenoma, Lobular carcinoma, etc.). However, breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images faces two main challenges from: (1) the great difficulties in breast cancer multi-classification methods contrasting with the classification of binary classes (benign and malignant), and (2) the subtle differences in multiple classes due to the broad variability of high-resolution image appearances, high coherency of cancerous cells, and extensive inhomogeneity of color distribution. Therefore, automated breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images is of great clinical significance yet has never been explored. Existing works in literature only focus on the binary classification but do not support further breast cancer quantitative assessment. In this study, we propose a breast cancer multi-classification method using a newly proposed deep learning model. The structured deep learning model has achieved remarkable performance (average 93.2{\%} accuracy) on a large-scale dataset, which demonstrates the strength of our method in providing an efficient tool for breast cancer multi-classification in clinical settings.},

Significant differences in the levels of spermine and spermidine were identified using S-plot, mass spectra, databases and standards. Based on the investigation of the polyamine metabolite pathway, these data establish that the downstream metabolites of ornithine are increased, potentially implicating ornithine decarboxylase activity in AD pathology.},

Objective Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists' diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. Design, Setting, and Participants Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). Exposures Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation. Main Outcomes and Measures The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4{\%} [95{\%} CI, 64.3{\%}-80.4{\%}]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95{\%} CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P {\textless} .001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95{\%} CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC). Conclusions and Relevance In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Because metabolites are hypothesized to play key roles as markers and effectors of cardiometabolic diseases, recent studies have sought to annotate the genetic determinants of circulating metabolite levels. We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 217 plasma metabolites, including {\textgreater}100 not measured in prior GWAS, in 2076 participants of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). For the majority of analytes, we find that estimated heritability explains {\textgreater}20{\%} of interindividual variation, and that variation attributable to heritable factors is greater than that attributable to clinical factors. Further, we identify 31 genetic loci associated with plasma metabolites, including 23 that have not previously been reported. Importantly, we include GWAS results for all surveyed metabolites and demonstrate how this information highlights a role for AGXT2 in cholesterol ester and triacylglycerol metabolism. Thus, our study outlines the relative contributions of inherited and clinical factors on the plasma metabolome and provides a resource for metabolism research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field consisting of the analysis of a large number of metabolites at a system scale. The two major goals of metabolomics are the identification of the metabolites characterizing each organism state and the measurement of their dynamics under different situations (e.g. pathological conditions, environmental factors). Knowledge about metabolites is crucial for the understanding of most cellular phenomena, but this information alone is not sufficient to gain a comprehensive view of all the biological processes involved. Integrated approaches combining metabolomics with transcriptomics and proteomics are thus required to obtain much deeper insights than any of these techniques alone. Although this information is available, multilevel integration of different 'omics' data is still a challenge. The handling, processing, analysis and integration of these data require specialized mathematical, statistical and bioinformatics tools, and several technical problems hampering a rapid progress in the field exist. Here, we review four main tools for number of users or provided features (MetaCore(TM), MetaboAnalyst, InCroMAP and 3Omics) out of the several available for metabolomic data analysis and integration with other 'omics' data, highlighting their strong and weak aspects; a number of related issues affecting data analysis and integration are also identified and discussed. Overall, we provide an objective description of how some of the main currently available software packages work, which may help the experimental practitioner in the choice of a robust pipeline for metabolomic data analysis and integration.},

abstract = {Metabolic profiling focuses on the analysis of a wide range of small endogenous molecules in order to understand the response of a living system to perturbations. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry is a widely employed profiling tool, but its application is limited by difficulties in identification of detected metabolites. Herein, we demonstrate how the prediction of retention time can help resolve this major issue. We describe a general approach that enables the generation of reliable quantitative structure retention rela- tionship models tailored to specific chromatographic pro- tocols. This methodology, applied to 442 experimentally characterised standards, employs a combination of random forest and support vector regression models with molecular interaction descriptors. In this unusual application, the Volsurf ? molecular descriptors demonstrated a high ability to describe chromatographic retention. On external validation sets, and for a wide range of chemical classes, predicted values were in average within 13 {\%} of the experimentally observed retention time. More importantly, the presented procedure reduced by more than 80 {\%} the number of false putative identification, greatly improving metabolite identification. Furthermore, in 95 {\%} of cases, the correct identification was promoted within the top three metabolite suggestions. This retention time prediction framework can be replicated by different laboratories to suit their profiling platforms and enhance the value of standard library by providing a new tool for compound identification.},

abstract = {Natural products (NPs) research is changing and rapidly adopting cutting-edge tools, which radically transform the way to characterize extracts and small molecules. With the innovations in metabolomics, early integration of deep metabolome annotation information allows to efficiently guide the isolation of valuable NPs only and, in parallel, to generate massive metadata sets for the study of given extracts under various perspectives. This is the case for chemotaxonomy studies where common biosynthetic traits among species can be evidenced, but also for drug discovery purpose where such traits, in combination with bioactivity studies on extracts, may evidence bioactive molecules even before their isolation. One of the major bottlenecks of such studies remains the level of accuracy at which NPs can be identified. We discuss here the advancements in LC–MS and associated mining methods by addressing what would be ideal and what is achieved today. We propose future developments for reinforcing generic NPs databases both in the spectral and structural dimensions by heading towards a virtuous metabolite identification cycle allowing annotation of both known and unreported metabolites in an iterative manner. Such approaches could significantly accelerate and improve our knowledge of the huge chemodiversity found in nature.},

It is usually diagnosed at advanced stages due to the limitations of current screening methods used in the clinic. There is an urgent need to develop new biomarkers and modalities to detect, diagnose, and monitor the disease. Metabonomics, an approach that involves the comprehensive profiling of the full complement of endogenous metabolites in a biological system, has demonstrated its great potential for use in the early diagnosis and personalized treatment of various cancers including CRC. By applying advanced analytical techniques and bioinformatics tools, the metabolome is mined for biomarkers that are associated with carcinogenesis and prognosis. This review provides an overview of the metabonomics workflow and studies, with a focus on recent advances and findings in biomarker discovery for the early diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.},

Indeed, techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, gas or liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, infrared and UV-visible spectroscopies have provided extensive datasets that can help in tasks as biological and biomedical discovery, biotechnology and drug development. However, as it happens with other omics data, the analysis of metabolomics datasets provides multiple challenges, both in terms of methodologies and in the development of appropriate computational tools. Indeed, from the available software tools, none addresses the multiplicity of existing techniques and data analysis tasks.In this work, we make available a novel R package, named specmine, which provides a set of methods for metabolomics data analysis, including data loading in different formats, pre-processing, metabolite identification, univariate and multivariate data analysis, machine learning, and feature selection. Importantly, the implemented methods provide adequate support for the analysis of data from diverse experimental techniques, integrating a large set of functions from several R packages in a powerful, yet simple to use environment.The package, already available in CRAN, is accompanied by a web site where users can deposit datasets, scripts and analysis reports to be shared with the community, promoting the efficient sharing of metabolomics data analysis pipelines.},

We investigated whether metabolite profiles could predict the development of diabetes. Among 2,422 normoglycemic individuals followed for 12 years, 201 developed diabetes. Amino acids, amines and other polar metabolites were profiled in baseline specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cases and controls were matched for age, body mass index and fasting glucose. Five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids had highly significant associations with future diabetes: isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. A combination of three amino acids predicted future diabetes (with a more than fivefold higher risk for individuals in top quartile). The results were replicated in an independent, prospective cohort. These findings underscore the potential key role of amino acid metabolism early in the pathogenesis of diabetes and suggest that amino acid profiles could aid in diabetes risk assessment.},

Connectivity within analyte communities enabled the identification of known and candidate biomarkers (e.g., gamma-glutamyltyrosine was densely interconnected with clinical analytes for cardiometabolic disease). We calculated polygenic scores from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 127 traits and diseases, and used these to discover molecular correlates of polygenic risk (e.g., genetic risk for inflammatory bowel disease was negatively correlated with plasma cystine). Finally, behavioral coaching informed by personal data helped participants to improve clinical biomarkers.

Methods: Metabolomic anal. using liq. chromatog. with Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS) was performed on plasma samples from 26 NVAMD patients and 19 controls.  Data were collected from mass/charge ratio (m/z) 85 to 850 on a Thermo LTQ-FT mass spectrometer, and metabolic features were extd. using an adaptive processing software package.  Both non-transformed and log2 transformed data were cor. using Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple testing.  Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Anal. was performed to det. metabolic features that distinguished NVAMD patients from controls.  Individual m/z features were matched to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and the Metlin metabolomics database, and metabolic pathways assocd. with NVAMD were identified using MetScape.  Results: Of the 1680 total m/z features detected by LC-FTMS, 94 unique m/z features were significantly different between NVAMD patients and controls using FDR (q = 0.05).  A comparison of these features to those found with log2 transformed data (n = 132, q = 0.2) revealed 40 features in common, reaffirming the involvement of certain metabolites.  Such metabolites included di- and tri-peptides, covalently modified amino acids, bile acids, and vitamin D-related metabolites.  Correlation anal. revealed assocns. among certain significant features, and pathway anal. demonstrated broader changes in tyrosine metab., sulfur amino acid metab., and amino acids related to urea metab.  Conclusions: These data suggest that metabolomic anal. can identify a panel of individual metabolites that differ between NVAMD cases and controls.  Pathway anal. can assess the involvement of certain metabolic pathways, such as tyrosine and urea metab., and can provide further insight into the pathophysiol. of AMD. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Here, we developed a metabolic pathway extension (MPE) approach to the fast characterization of metabolomic biomarkers. This approach was proposed based on a core concept that the whole metabolome is built from a limited number of initial metabolites via various kinds and multiple steps of metabolic reactions, and thus, theoretically, the whole metabolome might be mapped from the initial metabolites and metabolic reactions. Carnitine was used as an example of initial metabolites to validate this concept and the usefulness of MPE approach.

The precise temporal development of these biomarkers in relation to clinical progression is unclear. Earlier studies have been hampered by short follow-up. In an MCI cohort, we selected 15 patients who developed AD (MCI-AD) and 15 who remained cognitively stable during 4 years of follow-up. CSF was sampled at three serial occasions from each patient and analyzed for A$\beta$ peptides, the soluble amyloid-$\beta$ protein precursor protein fragments sA$\beta$PP$\alpha$ and sA$\beta$PP$\beta$, T-tau, P-tau, and chromogranin B, which is a protein linked to regulated neuronal secretion. We also measured, for the first time in MCI patients, an extended panel of A$\beta$ peptides by matrix-assisted-laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS). Most biomarkers were surprisingly stable over the four years with coefficients of variation below or close to 10{\%}. However, MCI-AD patients decreased in CSF A$\beta$X₋₄₀ and chromogranin B concentrations, which may indicate a reduced number of functional neurons or synapses with disease progression. The MS A$\beta$ peptide panel was more useful than any single A$\beta$ peptide to identify MCI-AD patients already at baseline. Knowledge on these biomarkers and their trajectories may facilitate early diagnosis of AD and be useful in future clinical trials to track effects of disease modifying drugs.},

Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved. IMPORTANCE: A deep learning system (DLS) is a machine learning technology with potential for screening diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a DLS in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, possible glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in community and clinic-based multiethnic populations with diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic performance of a DLS for diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases was evaluated using 494 661 retinal images. A DLS was trained for detectingdiabetic retinopathy (using 76 370 images), possible glaucoma (125189 images), and AMD (72 610 images), and performance of DLS was evaluated for detecting diabetic retinopathy (using 112 648 images), possible glaucoma (71896 images), and AMD (35 948 images). Training of the DLS was completed in May 2016, and validation of the DLS was completed in May 2017 for detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) and vision-threateningdiabetic retinopathy (severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse) using a primary validation data set in the Singapore National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program and 10 multiethnic cohorts with diabetes. EXPOSURES: Use of a deep learning system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity of the DLS with professional graders (retinal specialists, general ophthalmologists, trained graders, or optometrists) as the reference standard. RESULTS: In the primary validation dataset (n = 14 880 patients; 71 896 images; mean [SD] age, 60.2 [2.2]  years; 54.6{\%} men), the prevalence of referable diabetic retinopathy was 3.0{\%}; vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, 0.6{\%}; possible glaucoma, 0.1{\%}; and AMD 2.5{\%}. The AUC of the DLS for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0.936 (95{\%} CI, 0.925-0.943), sensitivity was 90.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 873{\%}-93.0{\%}), and specificity was 91.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 91.0{\%}-92.2{\%}). For vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, AUC was 0.958 (95{\%} CI, 0.956-0.961), sensitivity was 100{\%} (95{\%} CI, 94.1{\%}-100.0{\%}), and specificity was 91.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 90.7{\%}-91.4{\%}). For possible glaucoma, AUC was 0.942 (95{\%} CI, 0.929-0.954), sensitivity was 96.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 81.7{\%}-99.9{\%}), and specificity was 87.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 86.8{\%}-875{\%}). For AMD AUC was 0.931 (95{\%} CI, 0.928-0.935), sensitivity was 93.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 91.1{\%}-99.8{\%}), and specificity was 88.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 88.3{\%}-89.0{\%}). For referable diabetic retinopathy in the 10 additional datasets, AUC range was 0.889 to 0.983 (n = 40 752 images). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this evaluation of retinal images from multiethnic cohorts of patients with diabetes, the DLS had high sensitivity and specificity for identifying diabetic retinopathy and related eye diseases. Further research is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the DLS in health care settings and the utility of the DLS to improve vision outcomes.},

abstract = {Exposure to ionizing radiation has dramatically increased in modern society, raising serious health concerns. The molecular response to ionizing radiation, however, is still not completely understood. Here, we screened mouse serum for metabolic alterations following an acute exposure to $\gamma$ radiation using a multiplatform mass-spectrometry-based strategy. A global, molecular profiling revealed that mouse serum undergoes a series of significant molecular alterations following radiation exposure. We identified and quantified bioactive metabolites belonging to key biochemical pathways and low-abundance, oxygenated, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the two groups of animals. Exposure to $\gamma$ radiation induced a significant increase in the serum levels of ether phosphatidylcholines (PCs) while decreasing the levels of diacyl PCs carrying PUFAs. In exposed mice, levels of pro-inflammatory, oxygenated metabolites of arachidonic acid increased, whereas levels of anti-inflammatory metabolites of omega-3 PUFAs decreased. Our results indicate a specific serum lipidomic biosignature that could be utilized as an indicator of radiation exposure and as novel target for therapeutic intervention. Monitoring such a molecular response to radiation exposure might have implications not only for radiation pathology but also for countermeasures and personalized medicine.},

Given the direct connection between sphingomyelins (SM), ceramides, and apoptosis, these lipids may be indicators of neurodegeneration and AD progression. Baseline serum SM and ceramides from 100 women enrolled in a longitudinal population-based study were examined as predictors of cognitive impairment. Participants were followed up to six visits over 9 years. Baseline lipids, in tertiles, were examined in relation to cross-sectional and incident impairment ({\textless}1.5 S.D. below standard norms) on HVLT-immediate and -delayed memory recall and Trails A and B. SM and ceramides varied in relation to the timing of HVLT-delayed impairment: low levels were associated with cross-sectional impairment; high levels predicted incident impairment in asymptomatic individuals. Lipids were not associated with loss-to-follow-up. Results suggest serum SM and ceramides vary according to the timing of the onset of memory impairment and may be good pre-clinical predictors, or biomarkers, of memory impairment: a deficit observed early in AD pathogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we combine shotgun sequencing of fecal metagenomes with molecular phenomics (hepatic transcriptome and plasma and urine metabolomes) in two well-characterized cohorts of morbidly obese women recruited to the FLORINASH study. We reveal molecular networks linking the gut microbiome and the host phenome to hepatic steatosis. Patients with steatosis have low microbial gene richness and increased genetic potential for the processing of dietary lipids and endotoxin biosynthesis (notably from Proteobacteria), hepatic inflammation and dysregulation of aromatic and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. We demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplants and chronic treatment with phenylacetic acid, a microbial product of aromatic amino acid metabolism, successfully trigger steatosis and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Molecular phenomic signatures were predictive (area under the curve = 87{\%}) and consistent with the gut microbiome having an effect on the steatosis phenome ({\textgreater}75{\%} shared variation) and, therefore, actionable via microbiome-based therapies.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC), a major public health concern, is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed countries. There is a need for better preventive strategies to improve the patient outcome that is substantially influenced by cancer stage at the time of diagnosis. Patients with early stage colorectal have a significant higher 5-year survival rates compared to patients diagnosed at late stage. Although traditional colonoscopy remains the effective means to diagnose CRC, this approach generally suffers from poor patient compliance. Thus, it is important to develop more effective methods for early diagnosis of this disease process, also there is an urgent need for biomarkers to diagnose CRC, assess disease severity, and prognosticate course. Increasing availability of high-throughput methodologies open up new possibilities for screening new potential candidates for identifying biomarkers. Fortunately, metabolomics, the study of all metabolites produced in the body, considered most closely related to a patient's phenotype, can provide clinically useful biomarkers applied in CRC, and may now open new avenues for diagnostics. It has a largely untapped potential in the field of oncology, through the analysis of the cancer metabolome to identify marker metabolites defined here as surrogate indicators of physiological or pathophysiological states. In this review we take a closer look at the metabolomics used within the field of colorectal cancer. Further, we highlight the most interesting metabolomics publications and discuss these in detail; additional studies are mentioned as a reference for the interested reader. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Here we applied a comprehensive platform using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze plasma samples from AD patients, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and normal controls. A biomarker panel consisting of six plasma metabolites (arachidonic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, thymine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and cytidine) was identified to discriminate AD patients from normal control. Another panel of five plasma metabolites (thymine, arachidonic acid, 2-aminoadipic acid, N,N-dimethylglycine, and 5,8-tetradecadienoic acid) was able to differentiate aMCI patients from control subjects. Both biomarker panels had good agreements with clinical diagnosis. The 2 panels of metabolite markers were all involved in fatty acid metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, no altered metabolites were found among the patients at different stages, as well as among those on anticholinesterase medication and those without anticholinesterase medication. These findings provide a comprehensive global plasma metabolite profiling and may contribute to making early diagnosis as well as understanding the pathogenic mechanism of AD and aMCI.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) is used for comprehensive metabolome and lipidome analyses. Compound identification relies on similarity matching of the retention time (RT), precursor m/z, isotopic ratio, and MS/MS spectrum with reference compounds. For sphingolipids, however, little information on the RT and MS/MS references is available. RESULTS Negative-ion ESI-MS/MS is a useful method for the structural characterization of sphingolipids. We created theoretical MS/MS spectra for 21 sphingolipid classes in human and mouse (109,448 molecules), with substructure-level annotation of unique fragment ions by MS-FINDER software. The existence of ceramides with $\beta$-hydroxy fatty acids was confirmed in mouse tissues based on cheminformatic- and quantum chemical evidences. The RT of sphingo- and glycerolipid species was also predicted for our LC condition. With this information, MS-DIAL software for untargeted metabolome profiling could identify 415 unique structures including 282 glycerolipids and 133 sphingolipids from human cells (HEK and HeLa) and mouse tissues (ear and liver). CONCLUSIONS MS-DIAL and MS-FINDER software programs can identify 42 lipid classes (21 sphingo- and 21 glycerolipids) with the in silico RT and MS/MS library.

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia with an estimated worldwide prevalence of over 30 million people, and its incidence is expected to increase dramatically with an increasing elderly population. Up until now, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been the preferred sample to investigate central nervous system (CNS) disorders since its composition is directly related to metabolite production in the brain. In this work, a nontargeted metabolomic approach based on capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is developed to examine metabolic differences in CSF samples from subjects with different cognitive status related to AD progression. To do this, CSF samples from 85 subjects were obtained from patients with (i) subjective cognitive impairment (SCI, i.e. control group), (ii) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which remained stable after a follow-up period of 2 years, (iii) MCI which progressed to AD within a 2-year time after the initial MCI diagnostic and, (iv) diagnosed AD. A prediction model for AD progression using multivariate statistical analysis based on CE-MS metabolomics of CSF samples was obtained using 73 CSF samples. Using our model, we were able to correctly classify 97-100{\%} of the samples in the diagnostic groups. The prediction power was confirmed in a blind small test set of 12 CSF samples, reaching a 83{\%} of diagnostic accuracy. The obtained predictive values were higher than those reported with classical CSF AD biomarkers (A$\beta$42 and tau) but need to be confirmed in larger samples cohorts. Choline, dimethylarginine, arginine, valine, proline, serine, histidine, creatine, carnitine, and suberylglycine were identified as possible disease progression biomarkers. Our results suggest that CE-MS metabolomics of CSF samples can be a useful tool to predict AD progression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pregnancy triggers well-known alterations in maternal glucose and lipid balance but its overall effects on systemic metabolism remain incompletely understood. METHODS Detailed molecular profiles (87 metabolic measures and 37 cytokines) were measured for up to 4260 women (24-49 years, 322 pregnant) from three population-based cohorts in Finland. Circulating molecular concentrations in pregnant women were compared to those in non-pregnant women. Metabolic profiles were also reassessed for 583 women 6 years later to uncover the longitudinal metabolic changes in response to change in the pregnancy status. RESULTS Compared to non-pregnant women, all lipoprotein subclasses and lipids were markedly increased in pregnant women. The most pronounced differences were observed for the intermediate-density, low-density and high-density lipoprotein triglyceride concentrations. Large differences were also seen for many fatty acids and amino acids. Pregnant women also had higher concentrations of low-grade inflammatory marker glycoprotein acetyls, higher concentrations of interleukin-18 and lower concentrations of interleukin-12p70. The changes in metabolic concentrations for women who were not pregnant at baseline but pregnant 6 years later (or vice versa) matched (or were mirror-images of) the cross-sectional association pattern. Cross-sectional results were consistent across the three cohorts and similar longitudinal changes were seen for 653 women in 4-year and 497 women in 10-year follow-up. For multiple metabolic measures, the changes increased in magnitude across the three trimesters. CONCLUSIONS Pregnancy initiates substantial metabolic and inflammatory changes in the mothers. Comprehensive characterisation of normal pregnancy is important for gaining understanding of the key nutrients for fetal growth and development. These findings also provide a valuable molecular reference in relation to studies of adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

abstract = {Erd{\^{o}}'s [in: Chartrand (Ed.), The Theory and Applications of Graphs, Wiley, New York, 1981, p. 331] conjectured that the vertices of any graph with fewer than (2n+1/2) -(n/2) edges can be split into two parts, both parts inducing subgraphs of maximum degree less than . Recently, the first named author [Combinatorica 21 (2001) 403-412] disproved this conjecture. In this paper we consider further questions arising out of the conjecture. First of all, we give couterexamples to the conjecture having only 2n+ 80 vertices for large n. (The above counterexample had around n3/2/√2 vertices, though it had many fewer edges than our examples.) We also define the function b(n,m) to be the minimum size of a graph G such that, for any partition V(G) = AUB, either A(G[A])≥n or A(G[B]) {\textgreater} m holds. In this terminology, Erdos's conjecture was b(n,n) = (2n+1/2) {\~{}} (n/2). We Prove that b(n,m) = 2nm -m2+ O(√m)n for n ≥ m,b(n,1) = 4n - 2 for 11 {\textgreater} 7, and b(n,2) = 6n + O(1). Let m(n,k,j) be the minimum size of a graph G on n + k vertices in which A(G[A]) ≥ n for every (n +j)-sel A C V(G). We prove that, if k = o(n(n + j)/log n), then m(n,k,j) = (1+0(1)) (1 + k-j/2n+2j) (k-J+1)n as n →∞. The upper bound here disproves a conjecture made by Erd{\"{o}}s, Reid, Schelp and Staton [Discrete Math. 158 (1996) 283-286]. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Plasma sphingolipids have been shown to predict cognitive impairment and hippocampal volume loss, but there is little research in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we sought to determine whether plasma ceramides, dihydroceramides (DHCer), sphingomyelins (SM), or dihydrosphingomyelin (DHSM) levels and ratios of SM/ceramide or DHSM/DHCer were predictive of progression in AD. Probable AD patients (n = 120) were enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders Center at Baylor College of Medicine. Plasma sphingolipids were assessed using ESI/MS/MS. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the relation between baseline plasma sphingolipid levels and cross-sectional and longitudinal performance on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum). Participants were followed a mean of 4.2 visits and 2.3 years. There were no cross-sectional associations. In longitudinal analyses, high levels of DHCer and ceramide were associated with greater progression, but findings did not reach significance (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In contrast, higher plasma levels of SM, DHSM, SM/ceramide, and DHSM/DHCer ratios were associated with less progression on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog; the ratios were the strongest predictors of clinical progression. Compared to the lowest tertiles, the highest tertiles of DHSM/DHCer and SM/ceramide ratios declined 1.35 points (p = 0.001) and 1.19 (p = 0.004) points less per year on the MMSE and increased 3.18 (p = 0.001) and 2.42 (p = 0.016) points less per year on the ADAS-Cog. These results suggest that increased SM/ceramide and DHSM/DHCer ratios dose-dependently predict slower progression among AD patients and may be sensitive blood-based biomarkers for clinical progression.},

abstract = {Automatic food image recognition systems are alleviating the process of food-intake estimation and dietary assessment. However, due to the nature of food images, their recognition is a particularly challenging task, which is why traditional approaches in the field have achieved a low classification accuracy. Deep neural networks have outperformed such solutions, and we present a novel approach to the problem of food and drink image detection and recognition that uses a newly-defined deep convolutional neural network architecture, called NutriNet. This architecture was tuned on a recognition dataset containing 225,953 512 × 512 pixel images of 520 different food and drink items from a broad spectrum of food groups, on which we achieved a classification accuracy of 86.72{\%}, along with an accuracy of 94.47{\%} on a detection dataset containing 130,517 images. We also performed a real-world test on a dataset of self-acquired images, combined with images from Parkinson's disease patients, all taken using a smartphone camera, achieving a top-five accuracy of 55{\%}, which is an encouraging result for real-world images. Additionally, we tested NutriNet on the University of Milano-Bicocca 2016 (UNIMIB2016) food image dataset, on which we improved upon the provided baseline recognition result. An online training component was implemented to continually fine-tune the food and drink recognition model on new images. The model is being used in practice as part of a mobile app for the dietary assessment of Parkinson's disease patients.},

abstract = {This work presents the first NMR metabolomics study of maternal plasma during pregnancy, including correlation between plasma and urine metabolites. The expected decrease in circulating amino acids early in pregnancy was confirmed with six amino acids being identified as required by the fetus in larger extents. Newly observed changes in citrate, lactate, and dimethyl sulfone suggested early adjustments in energy and gut microflora metabolisms. Alterations in creatine levels were also noted, in addition to creatinine variations reflecting alterations in glomerular filtration rate. Regarding plasma macromolecules, HDL and LDL+VLDL levels were confirmed to increase throughout pregnancy, although at different rates and accompanied by increases in fatty acid chain length and degree of unsaturation. Correlation studies suggested (a) an inverse relationship between lipoproteins (HDL and LDL+VLDL) and albumin, with a possible direct correlation to excreted (unassigned) pregnancy markers resonating at $\delta$ 0.55 and $\delta$ 0.63, (b) a direct link between LDL+VLDL and N-acetyl-glycoproteins, together with excreted marker at $\delta$ 0.55, and (c) correlation of plasma albumin with particular circulating and excreted metabolites. These results have unveiled specific lipoprotein/protein metabolic aspects of pregnancy with impact on the excreted metabolome and, therefore, provide an interesting lead for the further understanding of pregnancy metabolism.},

Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

abstract = {Early and definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can lead to a better and more-targeted treatment and/or prevention for patients. In the diagnostic biomarkers of AD, the blood sample represents a more non-invasive, inexpensive and acceptable sources for repeated measurements than the cerebrospinal fluid. In this study, the fingerprinting metabolomics was proposed for the challenge of the blood-based diagnosis of defined AD by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HILIC/MS). These plasma samples were selected from postmortem specimens based on these pathological examinations. Firstly, we compared these HILIC columns for the non-targeted metabolic assay using pooled plasma. The principal component analysis plot of these seven columns was performed using the repeatability of these chromatograms, and can be used to visualize trends in data sets by three-dimensional dispersion, contributory standard deviation and the number of detections. Based on these results, TSK-Amide 80 and TSKgel-NH2 columns are used as a reliable HILIC/MS assay of blood-based AD metabolomics that showed metabolic profiling of the AD pathology in MS chromatograms that ranged from 1182 to 2284 compounds. A total of 54 peaks were evaluated in order to identify useful ion signal candidates using an orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis. These peaks were then specifically analyzed using the HILIC-tandem MS assay by a receiver operating characteristic curve and linear discriminant analysis for the diagnosis of the defined AD. The fingerprinting metabolomics can overcome the limitations of previous challenging blood-based diagnosis of AD, and directly evaluates the specific comparative statistical values from the raw data.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Epigenetic alteration has been implicated in aging. However, the mechanism by which epigenetic change impacts aging remains to be understood. H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using Drosophila, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. We show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

There is growing consensus that nonamyloid targets will be necessary to reverse or slow AD progression. Lipidomic, metabolomic and targeted approaches have identified pathways and products of sphingolipid metabolism that are altered early in the course of AD and contribute to the neuropathological alterations associated with AD, including amyloid-$\beta$ production, tau formation and neurodegeneration. In this article, we briefly review the current literature on the role of sphingolipids in the underlying pathophysiology of AD, and then discuss the current state of translating these findings to clinical populations and the potential utility of plasma sphingolipids as diagnostic and/or prognostic indicators of AD.},

In a commentary in BMC Medicine, Diamandis argues that HPWP and similar projects will likely result in 'unnecessary and potential harmful over-testing'. We argue that this new approach will ultimately lead to lower costs, better healthcare, innovation and economic growth. The central points of the HPWP are: 1) it is focused on optimizing wellness through longitudinal data collection, integration and mining of individual data clouds, enabling development of predictive models of wellness and disease that will reveal actionable possibilities; and 2) by extending this study to 100,000 well people, we will establish multiparameter, quantifiable wellness metrics and identify markers for wellness to early disease transitions for most common diseases, which will ultimately allow earlier disease intervention, eventually transitioning the individual early on from a disease back to a wellness trajectory.},

abstract = {One of the consequences in analyzing biological data from noisy sources, such as human subjects, is the sheer variability of experimentally irrelevant factors that cannot be controlled for. This holds true especially in metabolomics, the global study of small molecules in a particular system. While metabolomics can offer deep quantitative insight into the metabolome via easy-to-acquire biofluid samples such as urine and blood, the aforementioned confounding factors can easily overwhelm attempts to extract relevant information. This can mar potentially crucial applications such as biomarker discovery. As such, a new algorithm, called Selective Paired Ion Contrast (SPICA), has been developed with the intent of extracting potentially biologically relevant information from the noisiest of metabolomic datasets. The basic idea of SPICA is built upon redefining the fundamental unit of statistical analysis. Whereas the vast majority of algorithms analyze metabolomics data on a single-ion basis, SPICA relies on analyzing ion-pairs. A standard metabolomic data set is reinterpreted by exhaustively considering all possible ion-pair combinations. Statistical comparisons between sample groups are made only by analyzing the differences in these pairs, which may be crucial in situations where no single metabolite can be used for normalization. With SPICA, human urine data sets from patients undergoing total body irradiation (TBI), and from a colorectal cancer (CRC) relapse study were analyzed in a statistically rigorous manner not possible with conventional methods. In the TBI study, 3530 statistically significant ion-pairs were identified, from which numerous putative radiation specific metabolite-pair biomarkers that mapped to potentially perturbed metabolic pathways were elucidated. In the CRC study, SPICA identified 6461 statistically significant ion-pairs, several of which putatively mapped to folic acid biosynthesis, a key pathway in colorectal cancer. Utilizing support vector machines (SVMs), SPICA was also able to unequivocally outperform binary classifiers built from classical single-ion feature based SVMs.},

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (www.hmdb.ca) is a resource dedicated to providing scientists with the most current and comprehensive coverage of the human metabolome. Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate research for nearly 1000 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40,000 (a 600{\%} increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both 'detected' metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and 'expected' metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps. This article describes these enhancements to the HMDB, which was previously featured in the 2009 NAR Database Issue. (Note to referees, HMDB 3.0 will go live on 18 September 2012.).},

abstract = {The incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) increases with age and mortality exceeds 90{\%} when diagnosed after age 65. Most cases arise without any detectable early symptoms and patients usually present with the acute complications of bone marrow failure1. The onset of such de novo AML cases is typically preceded by the accumulation of somatic mutations in preleukaemic haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that undergo clonal expansion2,3. However, recurrent AML mutations also accumulate in HSPCs during ageing of healthy individuals who do not develop AML, a phenomenon referred to as age-related clonal haematopoiesis (ARCH)4–8. Here we use deep sequencing to analyse genes that are recurrently mutated in AML to distinguish between individuals who have a high risk of developing AML and those with benign ARCH. We analysed peripheral blood cells from 95 individuals that were obtained on average 6.3 years before AML diagnosis (pre-AML group), together with 414 unselected age- and gender-matched individuals (control group). Pre-AML cases were distinct from controls and had more mutations per sample, higher variant allele frequencies, indicating greater clonal expansion, and showed enrichment of mutations in specific genes. Genetic parameters were used to derive a model that accurately predicted AML-free survival; this model was validated in an independent cohort of 29 pre-AML cases and 262 controls. Because AML is rare, we also developed an AML predictive model using a large electronic health record database that identified individuals at greater risk. Collectively our findings provide proof-of-concept that it is possible to discriminate ARCH from pre-AML many years before malignant transformation. This could in future enable earlier detection and monitoring, and may help to inform intervention.},

A decrease in the CSF concentration of A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42 is a potential biomarker for incident AD. In contrast, studies on plasma A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42 concentrations have yielded contradictory results. To explore the relationship between plasma A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42 concentrations and AD in aging individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of plasma A$\beta$ and their ratio as a marker for progression to AD. We measured baseline concentrations of A$\beta$40 and A$\beta$42, and their ratio in plasma of patients carefully categorized clinically and neurochemically as having AD or other dementias from a cohort of patients with MCI (n=588) after 4-6 years of follow-up time. Plasma concentrations of A$\beta$40, A$\beta$42 were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology. The association between plasma A$\beta$ concentrations and the risk of dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Optimal sensitivity and specificity of A$\beta$ measurements were determined by ROC curve analysis. Plasma A$\beta$42 concentration and the A$\beta$42/A$\beta$40 ratio at baseline were significantly decreased in the MCI patients who developed AD as compared to cognitively stable MCI patients. The baseline concentrations of A$\beta$40 were similar in all MCI groups. The A$\beta$42/A$\beta$40 ratio was superior to A$\beta$42 concentration with regard to identify incipient AD in MCI. The ratio of A$\beta$42 to A$\beta$40 rather than absolute levels of the peptides can aid in the identification of incipient AD among MCI patients. A potential role of plasma A$\beta$ concentrations as a marker of incipient dementia warrants further investigation.},

While a mammalian Nanos family protein, NANOS2, is required for sexual differentiation of male (XY) germ cells in mice, the underlying mechanisms and the identities of its target RNAs in vivo remain elusive. Using comprehensive microarray analysis and a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic system, here we identify Dazl, a germ cell-specific gene encoding an RNA-binding protein implicated in translation, as a crucial target of NANOS2. Importantly, removal of the Dazl 30-untranslated region in XY germ cells stabilizes the Dazl mRNA, resulting in elevated meiotic gene expression, abnormal resumption of the cell cycle and impaired processing-body formation, reminiscent of Nanos2-knockout phenotypes.

abstract = {Despite recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the mechanisms of antipsychotic drug action, the development of biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in schizophrenia remains challenging. Metabolomics provides a powerful approach to discover diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers by analyzing global changes in an individual's metabolic profile in response to pathophysiological stimuli or drug intervention. In this study, we performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic profiling in serum of unmedicated schizophrenic patients before and after an 8-week risperidone monotherapy, to detect potential biomarkers associated with schizophrenia and risperidone treatment. Twenty-two marker metabolites contributing to the complete separation of schizophrenic patients from matched healthy controls were identified, with citrate, palmitic acid, myo-inositol, and allantoin exhibiting the best combined classification performance. Twenty marker metabolites contributing to the complete separation between posttreatment and pretreatment patients were identified, with myo-inositol, uric acid, and tryptophan showing the maximum combined classification performance. Metabolic pathways including energy metabolism, antioxidant defense systems, neurotransmitter metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and phospholipid metabolism were found to be disturbed in schizophrenic patients and partially normalized following risperidone therapy. Further study of these metabolites may facilitate the development of noninvasive biomarkers and more efficient therapeutic strategies for schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Biliary atresia (BA) is a rare neonatal cholestatic disorder caused by obstruction of extra- and intra-hepatic bile ducts. If untreated, progressive liver cirrhosis will lead to death within 2 years. Early diagnosis and operation improve the outcome significantly. Infants with neonatal hepatitis syndrome (NHS) present similar symptoms, confounding the early diagnosis of BA. The lack of noninvasive diagnostic methods to differentiate BA from NHS greatly delays the surgery of BA infants, thus deteriorating the outcome. Here we performed a metabolomics study in plasma of BA, NHS, and healthy infants using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Scores plots of orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis clearly separated BA from NHS and healthy infants. Eighteen metabolites were found to be differentially expressed between BA and NHS, among which seven (l-glutamic acid, l-ornithine, l-isoleucine, l-lysine, l-valine, l-tryptophan, and l-serine) were amino acids. The altered amino acids were quantitatively verified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the network of "Cellular Function and Maintenance, Hepatic System Development and Function, Neurological Disease" was altered most significantly. This study suggests that plasma metabolic profiling has great potential in differentiating BA from NHS, and amino acid metabolism is significantly different between the two diseases.},

abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography has been shown to reduce mortality by 20–43{\%} and is now included in US screening guidelines1–6. Existing challenges include inter-grader variability and high false-positive and false-negative rates7–10. We propose a deep learning algorithm that uses a patient's current and prior computed tomography volumes to predict the risk of lung cancer. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art performance (94.4{\%} area under the curve) on 6,716 National Lung Cancer Screening Trial cases, and performs similarly on an independent clinical validation set of 1,139 cases. We conducted two reader studies. When prior computed tomography imaging was not available, our model outperformed all six radiologists with absolute reductions of 11{\%} in false positives and 5{\%} in false negatives. Where prior computed tomography imaging was available, the model performance was on-par with the same radiologists. This creates an opportunity to optimize the screening process via computer assistance and automation. While the vast majority of patients remain unscreened, we show the potential for deep learning models to increase the accuracy, consistency and adoption of lung cancer screening worldwide.},

abstract = {Large-scale metabolomics study requires a quantitative method to generate metabolome data over an extended period with high technical reproducibility. We report a universal metabolome-standard (UMS) method, in conjunction with chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), to provide long-term analytical reproducibility and facilitate metabolome comparison among different data sets. In this method, UMS of a specific type of sample labeled by an isotope reagent is prepared a priori. The UMS is spiked into any individual samples labeled by another form of the isotope reagent in a metabolomics study. The resultant mixture is analyzed by LC-MS to provide relative quantification of the individual sample metabolome to UMS. UMS is independent of a study undertaking as well as the time of analysis and useful for profiling the same type of samples in multiple studies. In this work, the UMS method was developed and applied for a urine metabolomics study of bladder cancer. UMS of human urine was prepared by (13)C2-dansyl labeling of a pooled sample from 20 healthy individuals. This method was first used to profile the discovery samples to generate a list of putative biomarkers potentially useful for bladder cancer detection and then used to analyze the verification samples about one year later. Within the discovery sample set, three-month technical reproducibility was examined using a quality control sample and found a mean CV of 13.9{\%} and median CV of 9.4{\%} for all the quantified metabolites. Statistical analysis of the urine metabolome data showed a clear separation between the bladder cancer group and the control group from the discovery samples, which was confirmed by the verification samples. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) test showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.956 in the discovery data set and 0.935 in the verification data set. These results demonstrated the utility of the UMS method for long-term metabolomics and discovering potential metabolite biomarkers for diagnosis of bladder cancer.},

abstract = {Electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) is commonly used in high throughput metabolomics. One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures. This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum). In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.},

abstract = {Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been subjected to continuous investigation and its symptoms are well-known, early stage diagnosis of this disease remains difficult and the survival rate after diagnosis is typically very low (3-5{\%}). Early and accurate detection of metabolic changes in the sera of patients with liver cirrhosis can help improve the prognosis of HCC and lead to a better understanding of its mechanism at the molecular level, thus providing patients with in-time treatment of the disease. In this study, we compared metabolite levels in sera of 40 HCC patients and 49 cirrhosis patients from Egypt by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTOF MS). Following data preprocessing, the most relevant ions in distinguishing HCC cases from cirrhotic controls are selected by statistical methods. Putative metabolite identifications for these ions are obtained through mass-based database search. The identities of some of the putative identifications are verified by comparing their MS/MS fragmentation patterns and retention times with those from authentic compounds. Finally, the serum samples are reanalyzed for quantitation of selected metabolites as candidate biomarkers of HCC. This quantitation was performed using isotope dilution by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) on a triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqQLIT) coupled to UPLC. Statistical analysis of the UPLC-QTOF data identified 274 monoisotopic ion masses with statistically significant differences in ion intensities between HCC cases and cirrhotic controls. Putative identifications were obtained for 158 ions by mass based search against databases. We verified the identities of selected putative identifications including glycholic acid (GCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), 3$\beta$, 6$\beta$-dihydroxy-5$\beta$-cholan-24-oic acid, oleoyl carnitine, and Phe-Phe. SRM-based quantitation confirmed significant differences between HCC and cirrhotic controls in metabolite levels of bile acid metabolites, long chain carnitines and small peptide. Our study provides useful insight into appropriate experimental design and computational methods for serum biomarker discovery using LC-MS/MS based metabolomics. This study has led to the identification of candidate biomarkers with significant changes in metabolite levels between HCC cases and cirrhotic controls. This is the first MS-based metabolic biomarker discovery study on Egyptian subjects that led to the identification of candidate metabolites that discriminate early stage HCC from patients with liver cirrhosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Extracting relevant biological information from large data sets is a major challenge in functional genomics research. Different aspects of the data hamper their biological interpretation. For instance, 5000-fold differences in concentration for different metabolites are present in a metabolomics data set, while these differences are not proportional to the biological relevance of these metabolites. However, data analysis methods are not able to make this distinction. Data pretreatment methods can correct for aspects that hinder the biological interpretation of metabolomics data sets by emphasizing the biological information in the data set and thus improving their biological interpretability. RESULTS Different data pretreatment methods, i.e. centering, autoscaling, pareto scaling, range scaling, vast scaling, log transformation, and power transformation, were tested on a real-life metabolomics data set. They were found to greatly affect the outcome of the data analysis and thus the rank of the, from a biological point of view, most important metabolites. Furthermore, the stability of the rank, the influence of technical errors on data analysis, and the preference of data analysis methods for selecting highly abundant metabolites were affected by the data pretreatment method used prior to data analysis. CONCLUSION Different pretreatment methods emphasize different aspects of the data and each pretreatment method has its own merits and drawbacks. The choice for a pretreatment method depends on the biological question to be answered, the properties of the data set and the data analysis method selected. For the explorative analysis of the validation data set used in this study, autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods. That is, range scaling and autoscaling were able to remove the dependence of the rank of the metabolites on the average concentration and the magnitude of the fold changes and showed biologically sensible results after PCA (principal component analysis).In conclusion, selecting a proper data pretreatment method is an essential step in the analysis of metabolomics data and greatly affects the metabolites that are identified to be the most important.},

Reporting of standard metadata provides a biological and empirical context for the data, facilitates experimental replication, and enables the re-interrogation and comparison of data by others. Accordingly, the Metabolomics Standards Initiative is building a general consensus concerning the minimum reporting standards for metabolomics experiments of which the Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) is a member of this community effort. This article proposes the minimum reporting standards related to the chemical analysis aspects of metabolomics experiments including: sample preparation, experimental analysis, quality control, metabolite identification, and data pre-processing. These minimum standards currently focus mostly upon mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy due to the popularity of these techniques in metabolomics. However, additional input concerning other techniques is welcomed and can be provided via the CAWG on-line discussion forum at http://msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net/ or http://Msi-workgroups-feedback@lists.sourceforge.net. Further, community input related to this document can also be provided via this electronic forum.},

abstract = {Gas chromatography using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/APCI-MS) is an emerging metabolomics platform, providing much-enhanced capabilities for structural mass spectrometry as compared to traditional electron ionization (EI)-based techniques. To exploit the potential of GC/APCI-MS for more comprehensive metabolite annotation, a major bottleneck in metabolomics, we here present the novel R-based tool InterpretMSSpectrum assisting in the common task of annotating and evaluating in-source mass spectra as obtained from typical full-scan experiments. When passed a list of mass-intensity pairs, InterpretMSSpectrum locates the molecular ion (M0), fragment and adduct peaks, calculates their most likely sum formula combination and graphically summarizes results as an annotated mass spectrum. Using (modifiable) filter rules for the commonly used methoximated-trimethylsilylated (MeOx-TMS) derivatives, covering elemental composition, typical substructures, neutral losses and adducts, InterpretMSSpectrum significantly reduces the number of sum formula candidates, minimizing manual effort for post-processing candidate lists. We demonstrate the utility of InterpretMSSpectrum for 86 in-source spectra of derivatized standard compounds, in which rank-1 sum formula assignments were achieved in 84{\%} of the cases, compared to only 63{\%} when using mass and isotope information of the M0 alone. We further use, for the first time, automated annotation to evaluate the purity of pseudospectra generated by different metabolomics preprocessing tools, showing that automated annotation can serve as an integrative quality measure for peak picking/deconvolution methods. As an R package, InterpretMSSpectrum integrates flexibly into existing metabolomics pipelines and is freely available from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/).},

abstract = {Annotation of metabolites remains a major challenge in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) based untargeted metabolomics. The current gold standard for metabolite identification is to match the detected feature with an authentic standard analyzed on the same equipment and using the same method as the experimental samples. However, there are substantial practical challenges in applying this approach to large data sets. One widely used annotation approach is to search spectral libraries in reference databases for matching metabolites; however, this approach is limited by the incomplete coverage of these libraries. An alternative computational approach is to match the detected features to candidate chemical structures based on their mass and predicted fragmentation pattern. Unfortunately, both of these approaches can match multiple identities with a single feature. Another issue is that annotations from different tools often disagree.

abstract = {Recommender system is a specific type of intelligent systems, which exploits historical user ratings on items and/or auxiliary information to make recommendations on items to the users. It plays a critical role in a wide range of online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete cold start (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete cold start (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for cold start items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of cold start items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from cold start to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for cold start item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of cold start item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote cold start items.},

Whereas a vaccine is available for prevention of shingles, its efficacy declines with age. To help to understand the mechanisms driving vaccinal responses, we constructed a multiscale, multifactorial response network (MMRN) of immunity in healthy young and older adults immunized with the live attenuated shingles vaccine Zostavax. Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4+ T cells yet limited CD8+ T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.},

abstract = {First released in 2009, MetaboAnalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca) was a relatively simple web server designed to facilitate metabolomic data processing and statistical analysis. With continuing advances in metabolomics along with constant user feedback, it became clear that a substantial upgrade to the original server was necessary. MetaboAnalyst 2.0, which is the successor to MetaboAnalyst, represents just such an upgrade. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 now contains dozens of new features and functions including new procedures for data filtering, data editing and data normalization. It also supports multi-group data analysis, two-factor analysis as well as time-series data analysis. These new functions have also been supplemented with: (i) a quality-control module that allows users to evaluate their data quality before conducting any analysis, (ii) a functional enrichment analysis module that allows users to identify biologically meaningful patterns using metabolite set enrichment analysis and (iii) a metabolic pathway analysis module that allows users to perform pathway analysis and visualization for 15 different model organisms. In developing MetaboAnalyst 2.0 we have also substantially improved its graphical presentation tools. All images are now generated using anti-aliasing and are available over a range of resolutions, sizes and formats (PNG, TIFF, PDF, PostScript, or SVG). To improve its performance, MetaboAnalyst 2.0 is now hosted on a much more powerful server with substantially modified code to take advantage the server's multi-core CPUs for computationally intensive tasks. MetaboAnalyst 2.0 also maintains a collection of 50 or more FAQs and more than a dozen tutorials compiled from user queries and requests. A downloadable version of MetaboAnalyst 2.0, along detailed instructions for local installation is now available as well.},

KEGG at http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ is the reference knowledge base that integrates current knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes (PATHWAY database), information about genes and proteins generated by genome projects (GENES/SSDB/KO databases) and information about biochemical compounds and reactions (COMPOUND/GLYCAN/REACTION databases). These three types of database actually represent three graph objects, called the protein network, the gene universe and the chemical universe. New efforts are being made to abstract knowledge, both computationally and manually, about ortholog clusters in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, and to collect and analyze carbohydrate structures in the GLYCAN database.},

abstract = {Here we present a proof of concept cross-platform normalization approach to convert raw mass spectra acquired by distinct desorption ionization methods and/or instrumental setups to cross-platform normalized analyte profiles. The initial step of the workflow is database driven peak annotation followed by summarization of peak intensities of different ions from the same molecule. The resulting compound-intensity spectra are adjusted to a method-independent intensity scale by using predetermined, compound-specific normalization factors. The method is based on the assumption that distinct MS-based platforms capture a similar set of chemical species in a biological sample, though these species may exhibit platform-specific molecular ion intensity distribution patterns. The method was validated on two sample sets of (1) porcine tissue analyzed by laser desorption ionization (LDI), desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), and rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometric (REIMS) in combination with Fourier transformation-based mass spectrometry; and (2) healthy/cancerous colorectal tissue analyzed by DESI and REIMS with the latter being combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We demonstrate the capacity of our method to reduce MS-platform specific variation resulting in (1) high inter-platform concordance coefficients of analyte intensities; (2) clear principal component based clustering of analyte profiles according to histological tissue types, irrespective of the used desorption ionization technique or mass spectrometer; and (3) accurate "blind" classification of histologic tissue types using cross-platform normalized analyte profiles.},

Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus are identified as the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs and insulin resistance, and in mice we demonstrate that P. copri can induce insulin resistance, aggravate glucose intolerance and augment circulating levels of BCAAs.

Here we report a global metabolic profiling study involving 112 schizophrenic patients and 110 healthy subjects, who were divided into a training set and a test set, designed to identify metabolite markers. A panel of serum markers consisting of glycerate, eicosenoic acid, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate and cystine was identified as an effective diagnostic tool, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.945 in the training samples (62 patients and 62 controls) and 0.895 in the test samples (50 patients and 48 controls). Furthermore, a composite panel by the addition of urine $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate to the serum panel achieved a more satisfactory accuracy, which reached an AUC of 1 in both the training set and the test set. Multiple fatty acids and ketone bodies were found significantly (P{\textless}0.01) elevated in both the serum and urine of patients, suggesting an upregulated fatty acid catabolism, presumably resulting from an insufficiency of glucose supply in the brains of schizophrenia patients.},

An organism's biochemical pool, however, comprises complex transboundary relationships, which can only be understood by investigating metabolic interactions and physiological processes spanning multiple parts of the human body. Therefore, we here propose a datadriven network-based approach to generate an integrated picture of metabolomics associations over multiple fluids. We performed an analysis of 2251 metabolites measured in plasma, urine, and saliva, from 374 participants of the Qatar Metabolomics Study on Diabetes (QMDiab). Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) were used to estimate metabolite-metabolite interactions on different subsets of the data set. First, we compared similarities and differences of the metabolome and the association networks between the three fluids. Second, we investigated the cross-talk between the fluids by analyzing correlations occurring between them. Third, we propose a framework for the analysis of medically relevant phenotypes by integrating type 2 diabetes, sex, age, and body mass index into our networks. In conclusion, we present a generic, data-driven network-based approach for structuring and visualizing metabolite correlations within and between multiple body fluids, enabling unbiased interpretation of metabolomics multifluid data.},

abstract = {A specific, sensitive and essentially non-invasive assay to diagnose and monitor Alzheimer's disease (AD) would be valuable to both clinicians and medical researchers. The aim of this study was to perform a metabonomic statistical analysis on plasma fingerprints. Objectives were to investigate novel biomarkers indicative of AD, to consider the role of bile acids as AD biomarkers and to consider whether mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a separate disease from AD. Samples were analysed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-MS and resulting data sets were interpreted using soft-independent modelling of class analogy statistical analysis methods. PCA models did not show any grouping of subjects by disease state. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DS) models yielded class separation for AD. However, as with earlier studies, model validation revealed a predictive power of Q(2){\textless}0.5 and indicating their unsuitability for predicting disease state. Three bile acids were extracted from the data and quantified, up-regulation was observed for MCI and AD patients. PLS-DA did not support MCI being considered as a separate disease from AD with MCI patient metabolic profiles being significantly closer to AD patients than controls. This study suggested that further investigation into the lipid fraction of the metabolome may yield useful biomarkers for AD and metabolomic profiles could be used to predict disease state in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Annotation of metabolites remains a major challenge in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) based untargeted metabolomics. The current gold standard for metabolite identification is to match the detected feature with an authentic standard analyzed on the same equipment and using the same method as the experimental samples. However, there are substantial practical challenges in applying this approach to large data sets. One widely used annotation approach is to search spectral libraries in reference databases for matching metabolites; however, this approach is limited by the incomplete coverage of these libraries. An alternative computational approach is to match the detected features to candidate chemical structures based on their mass and predicted fragmentation pattern. Unfortunately, both of these approaches can match multiple identities with a single feature. Another issue is that annotations from different tools often disagree. This paper presents a novel LC–MS data annotation method, term...},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder still in search of effective methods of diagnosis. Altered levels of the NMDA receptor co-agonist, d-serine, have been associated with neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and epilepsy. However, whether d-serine levels are deregulated in AD remains elusive. Here, we first measured D-serine levels in post-mortem hippocampal and cortical samples from nondemented subjects (n=8) and AD patients (n=14). We next determined d-serine levels in experimental models of AD, including wild-type rats and mice that received intracerebroventricular injections of amyloid-$\beta$ oligomers, and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Finally, we assessed d-serine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 21 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD, as compared with patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (n=9), major depression (n=9) and healthy controls (n=10), and results were contrasted with CSF amyloid-$\beta$/tau AD biomarkers. d-serine levels were higher in the hippocampus and parietal cortex of AD patients than in control subjects. Levels of both d-serine and serine racemase, the enzyme responsible for d-serine production, were elevated in experimental models of AD. Significantly, d-serine levels were higher in the CSF of probable AD patients than in non-cognitively impaired subject groups. Combining d-serine levels to the amyloid/tau index remarkably increased the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of probable AD in our cohort. Our results show that increased brain and CSF d-serine levels are associated with AD. CSF d-serine levels discriminated between nondemented and AD patients in our cohort and might constitute a novel candidate biomarker for early AD diagnosis.},

abstract = {Gas chromatography using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/APCI-MS) is an emerging metabolomics platform, providing much-enhanced capabilities for structural mass spectrometry as compared to traditional electron ionization (EI)-based techniques. To exploit the potential of GC/APCI-MS for more comprehensive metabolite annotation, a major bottleneck in metabolomics, we here present the novel R-based tool InterpretMSSpectrum assisting in the common task of annotating and evaluating in-source mass spectra as obtained from typical full-scan experiments. When passed a list of mass-intensity pairs, InterpretMSSpectrum locates the molecular ion (M0), fragment and adduct peaks, calculates their most likely sum formula combination and graphically summarizes results as an annotated mass spectrum. Using (modifiable) filter rules for the commonly used methoximated-trimethylsilylated (MeOx-TMS) derivatives, covering elemental composition, typical substructures, neutral losses and adducts, InterpretMSSpectrum significantly reduces the number of sum formula candidates, minimizing manual effort for post-processing candidate lists. We demonstrate the utility of InterpretMSSpectrum for 86 in-source spectra of derivatized standard compounds, in which rank-1 sum formula assignments were achieved in 84{\%} of the cases, compared to only 63{\%} when using mass and isotope information of the M0 alone. We further use, for the first time, automated annotation to evaluate the purity of pseudospectra generated by different metabolomics preprocessing tools, showing that automated annotation can serve as an integrative quality measure for peak picking/deconvolution methods. As an R package, InterpretMSSpectrum integrates flexibly into existing metabolomics pipelines and is freely available from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/).},

abstract = {At the earliest clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), when first symptoms are mild, making a reliable and accurate diagnosis is difficult. AD related brain pathology and underlying molecular mechanisms precede symptoms. Biological markers can serve as supportive early screening and diagnostic tools as well as indicators of presymptomatic biochemical change. Moreover, biomarkers cover a variety of roles and functions such as disease prediction, indicating disease acuity and progression, and may ensure biological mapping of treatment outcome. Early screening, detection, and diagnosis of AD would permit earlier disease modifying intervention at potentially reversible stages. To date, most established biological markers from both cerebrospinal fluid neurochemistry and structural and functional neuroimaging have not reached widespread clinical application. Crucial remaining problems, such as easy acceptance and application of a test, cost-effectiveness, and noninvasiveness, need to be resolved. The development and validation of precise, reliable, and robust tests and biomarkers in blood, plasma, or serum has therefore been for a long time the ultimate focus of many research groups worldwide. Blood-based testing will most likely be the prerequisite to future sensitive screening of large populations at risk of AD and the baseline in a diagnostic flow approach to AD. The status and emerging perspectives on hypothesis and exploratory-based candidate biomarkers derived from blood, plasma, and serum are reviewed and discussed.},

Here we report a fetal genome-wide association meta-analysis of gestational duration, and early preterm, preterm, and postterm birth in 84,689 infants. One locus on chromosome 2q13 is associated with gestational duration; the association is replicated in 9,291 additional infants (combined P = 3.96 × 10−14). Analysis of 15,588 mother-child pairs shows that the association is driven by fetal rather than maternal genotype. Functional experiments show that the lead SNP, rs7594852, alters the binding of the HIC1 transcriptional repressor. Genes at the locus include several interleukin 1 family members with roles in pro-inflammatory pathways that are central to the process of parturition. Further understanding of the underlying mechanisms will be of great public health importance, since giving birth either before or after the window of term gestation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Untargeted metabolomics of environmental samples routinely detects thousands of small molecules, the vast majority of which cannot be identified. Meta-mass shift chemical (MeMSChem) profiling was developed to identify mass differences between related molecules using molecular networks. This approach illuminates metabolome-wide relationships between molecules and the putative chemical groups that differentiate them (e.g., H2, CH2, COCH2). MeMSChem profiling was used to analyze a publicly available metabolomic dataset of coral, algal, and fungal mat holobionts (i.e., the host and its associated microbes and viruses) sampled from some of Earth's most remote and pristine coral reefs. Each type of holobiont had distinct mass shift profiles, even when the analysis was restricted to molecules found in all samples. This result suggests that holobionts modify the same molecules in different ways and offers insights into the generation of molecular diversity. Three genera of stony corals had distinct patterns of molecular relatedness despite their high degree of taxonomic relatedness. MeMSChem profiles also partially differentiated between individuals, suggesting that every coral reef holobiont is a potential source of novel chemical diversity.},

We identify 1,459 significant locus-trait associations (P≤1.8 × 10(-6)) across three environments through metabolite-based genome-wide association mapping. Most (58.5{\%}) of the identified loci are supported by expression QTLs, and some (14.7{\%}) are validated through linkage mapping.

The abundance of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a glutamate-fermenting commensal, was markedly decreased in obese individuals and was inversely correlated with serum glutamate concentration. Consistently, gavage with B. thetaiotaomicron reduced plasma glutamate concentration and alleviated diet-induced body-weight gain and adiposity in mice. Furthermore, weight-loss intervention by bariatric surgery partially reversed obesity-associated microbial and metabolic alterations in obese individuals, including the decreased abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron and the elevated serum glutamate concentration. Our findings identify previously unknown links between intestinal microbiota alterations, circulating amino acids and obesity, suggesting that it may be possible to intervene in obesity by targeting the gut microbiota.},

CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7{\%} and 90.3{\%} of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate.

Unfortunately among the many published metabolomic studies focusing on biomarker discovery, there is very little consistency and relatively little rigor in how researchers select, assess or report their candidate biomarkers. In particular, few studies report any measure of sensitivity, specificity, or provide receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves with associated confidence intervals. Even fewer studies explicitly describe or release the biomarker model used to generate their ROC curves. This is surprising given that for biomarker studies in most other biomedical fields, ROC curve analysis is generally considered the standard method for performance assessment. Because the ultimate goal of biomarker discovery is the translation of those biomarkers to clinical practice, it is clear that the metabolomics community needs to start "speaking the same language" in terms of biomarker analysis and reporting-especially if it wants to see metabolite markers being routinely used in the clinic. In this tutorial, we will first introduce the concept of ROC curves and describe their use in single biomarker analysis for clinical chemistry. This includes the construction of ROC curves, understanding the meaning of area under ROC curves (AUC) and partial AUC, as well as the calculation of confidence intervals. The second part of the tutorial focuses on biomarker analyses within the context of metabolomics. This section describes different statistical and machine learning strategies that can be used to create multi-metabolite biomarker models and explains how these models can be assessed using ROC curves. In the third part of the tutorial we discuss common issues and potential pitfalls associated with different analysis methods and provide readers with a list of nine recommendations for biomarker analysis and reporting. To help readers test, visualize and explore the concepts presented in this tutorial, we also introduce a web-based tool called ROCCET (ROC Curve Explorer {\&} Tester, http://www.roccet.ca). ROCCET was originally developed as a teaching aid but it can also serve as a training and testing resource to assist metabolomics researchers build biomarker models and conduct a range of common ROC curve analyses for biomarker studies.},

abstract = {The study of the omics cascade, which involves comprehensive investigations based on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc., has developed rapidly and now plays an important role in life science research. Among such analyses, metabolome analysis, in which the concentrations of low molecular weight metabolites are comprehensively analyzed, has rapidly developed along with improvements in analytical technology, and hence, has been applied to a variety of research fields including the clinical, cell biology, and plant/food science fields. The metabolome represents the endpoint of the omics cascade and is also the closest point in the cascade to the phenotype. Moreover, it is affected by variations in not only the expression but also the enzymatic activity of several proteins. Therefore, metabolome analysis can be a useful approach for finding effective diagnostic markers and examining unknown pathological conditions. The number of studies involving metabolome analysis has recently been increasing year-on-year. Here, we describe the findings of studies that used metabolome analysis to attempt to discover biomarker candidates for gastroenterological cancer and discuss metabolome analysis-based disease diagnosis.},

Using Tied Diffusion through Interacting Events (TieDIE), we integrated differentially expressed master transcriptional regulators, functionally mutated genes, and differentially activated kinases in CRPC tissues to synthesize a robust signaling network consisting of druggable kinase pathways. Using MSigDB hallmark gene sets, six major signaling pathways with phosphorylation of several key residues were significantly enriched in CRPC tumors after incorporation of phosphoproteomic data. Individual autopsy profiles developed using these hallmarks revealed clinically relevant pathway information potentially suitable for patient stratification and targeted therapies in late stage prostate cancer. Here, we describe phosphorylation-based cancer hallmarks using integrated personalized signatures (pCHIPS) that shed light on the diversity of activated signaling pathways in metastatic CRPC while providing an integrative, pathway-based reference for drug prioritization in individual patients.},

The use of PTR-MS in atmospheric research has expanded rapidly in recent years, and much has been learned about the instrument response and specificity of the technique in the analysis of air from different regions of the atmosphere. This paper aims to review the progress that has been made. The theory of operation is described and allows the response of the instrument to be described for different operating conditions. More accurate determinations of the instrument response involve calibrations using standard mixtures, and some results are shown. Much has been learned about the specificity of PTR-MS from inter-comparison studies as well the coupling of PTR-MS with a gas chromatographic interface. The literature on this issue is reviewed and summarized for many VOCs of atmospheric interest. Some highlights of airborne measurements by PTR-MS are presented, including the results obtained in fresh and aged forest-fire and urban plumes. Finally, the recent work that is focused on improving the technique is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calcium deficiency is a global public-health problem. Although the initial stage of calcium deficiency can lead to metabolic alterations or potential pathological changes, calcium deficiency is difficult to diagnose accurately. Moreover, the details of the molecular mechanism of calcium deficiency remain somewhat elusive. To accurately assess and provide appropriate nutritional intervention, we carried out a global analysis of metabolic alterations in response to calcium deficiency.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The metabolic alterations associated with calcium deficiency were first investigated in a rat model, using urinary metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. Correlations between dietary calcium intake and the biomarkers identified from the rat model were further analyzed to confirm the potential application of these biomarkers in humans.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Urinary metabolic-profiling analysis could preliminarily distinguish between calcium-deficient and non-deficient rats after a 2-week low-calcium diet. We established an integrated metabonomics strategy for identifying reliable biomarkers of calcium deficiency using a time-course analysis of discriminating metabolites in a low-calcium diet experiment, repeating the low-calcium diet experiment and performing a calcium-supplement experiment. In total, 27 biomarkers were identified, including glycine, oxoglutaric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, sebacic acid, pseudouridine, indoxyl sulfate, taurine, and phenylacetylglycine. The integrated urinary metabonomics analysis, which combined biomarkers with regular trends of change (types A, B, and C), could accurately assess calcium-deficient rats at different stages and clarify the dynamic pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanism of calcium deficiency in detail. Significant correlations between calcium intake and two biomarkers, pseudouridine (Pearson correlation, r = 0.53, P = 0.0001) and citrate (Pearson correlation, r = -0.43, P = 0.001), were further confirmed in 70 women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of reliable biomarkers of calcium deficiency, which were identified using an integrated strategy. The identified biomarkers give new insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms of calcium deficiency. The correlations between calcium intake and two of the biomarkers provide a rationale or potential for further assessment and elucidation of the metabolic responses of calcium deficiency in humans.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Epigenetic alteration has been implicated in aging. However, the mechanism by which epigenetic change impacts aging remains to be understood. H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using Drosophila, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. We show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this study, a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to find the differential metabolites in plasma samples from patients with MDD and healthy controls. Furthermore, a validation analysis focusing on the differential metabolites was performed in another batch of samples using a targeted approach based on the dynamic multiple reactions monitoring method. Levels of acyl carnitines, ether lipids, and tryptophan pronouncedly decreased, whereas LPCs, LPEs, and PEs markedly increased in MDD subjects as compared with the healthy controls. Disturbed pathways, mainly located in acyl carnitine metabolism, lipid metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism, were clearly brought to light in MDD subjects. The binary logistic regression result showed that carnitine C10:1, PE-O 36:5, LPE 18:1 sn-2, and tryptophan can be used as a combinational biomarker to distinguish not only moderate but also severe MDD from healthy control with good sensitivity and specificity.

abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images-two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets-consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

abstract = {Patients with pancreatic cancer (PC) are usually diagnosed at late stages, when the disease is nearly incurable. Sensitive and specific markers are critical for supporting diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The aim of this study was to use a metabonomics approach to identify potential plasma biomarkers that can be further developed for early detection of PC. In this study, plasma metabolites of newly diagnosed PC patients (n=100) and age- and gender-matched controls (n=100) from Connecticut (CT), USA, and the same number of cases and controls from Shanghai (SH), China were profiled using combined gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The metabolites consistently expressed in both CT and SH samples were used to identify potential markers, and the diagnostic performance of the candidate markers was tested in two sample sets, respectively. A diagnostic model was constructed using a panel of 5 metabolites including glutamate, choline, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, betaine, and methylguanidine, which robustly distinguished PC patients in CT from controls with high sensitivity (97.7{\%}) and specificity (83.1{\%}) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.943, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.908- 0.977). This panel of metabolites was then tested with the SH data set, yielding satisfactory accuracy (AUC = 0.835; 95{\%} CI = 0.777-0.893), sensitivity of 77.4{\%} and specificity of 75.8{\%}. This model achieved a sensitivity of 84.8{\%} in the PC patients at stage 0, 1 and 2 in CT and 77.4{\%} in the PC patients at stage 1 and 2 in SH. Plasma metabolic signatures show promise as biomarkers for early detection of PC.},

Here we develop a 29-gene ECM-related prognostic and predictive indicator (EPPI). We validate a robust performance of the EPPI risk scoring system in multiple independent data sets, comprising a total of 2,071 early-stage NSCLC tumors. Patients are stratified according to the universal cutoff score based on the EPPI when applied in the clinical setting; the low-risk group has significantly better survival outcome. The functional EPPI gene set represents a potential genomic tool to improve patient selection in early-stage NSCLC to further derive the best benefits of ACT and prevent unnecessary treatment or ACT-associated morbidity.},

abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered as a transition phase between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI confers an increased risk of developing AD, although the state is heterogeneous with several possible outcomes, including even improvement back to normal cognition. We sought to determine the serum metabolomic profiles associated with progression to and diagnosis of AD in a prospective study. At the baseline assessment, the subjects enrolled in the study were classified into three diagnostic groups: healthy controls (n=46), MCI (n=143) and AD (n=47). Among the MCI subjects, 52 progressed to AD in the follow-up. Comprehensive metabolomics approach was applied to analyze baseline serum samples and to associate the metabolite profiles with the diagnosis at baseline and in the follow-up. At baseline, AD patients were characterized by diminished ether phospholipids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and sterols. A molecular signature comprising three metabolites was identified, which was predictive of progression to AD in the follow-up. The major contributor to the predictive model was 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, which was upregulated in AD progressors (P=0.0048), indicating potential involvement of hypoxia in the early AD pathogenesis. This was supported by the pathway analysis of metabolomics data, which identified upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway in patients who later progressed to AD. Together, our findings primarily implicate hypoxia, oxidative stress, as well as membrane lipid remodeling in progression to AD. Establishment of pathogenic relevance of predictive biomarkers such as ours may not only facilitate early diagnosis, but may also help identify new therapeutic avenues.},

Its unique focus on small molecules and the physiological effects of small molecules aligns the field of metabolomics very closely with the aims and interests of many researchers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because of its conceptual and technical overlap with many aspects of pharmaceutical research, metabolomics is now finding applications that span almost the full length of the drug discovery and development pipeline, from lead compound discovery to post-approval drug surveillance. This review explores some of the most interesting or significant applications of metabolomics as they relate to pharmaceutical research and development. Specific examples are given that show how metabolomics can be used to facilitate lead compound discovery, to improve biomarker identification (for monitoring disease status and drug efficacy) and to monitor drug metabolism and toxicity. Other applications are also discussed, including the use of metabolomics to facilitate clinical trial testing and to improve post-approval drug monitoring. These examples show that metabolomics potentially offer drug researchers and drug regulators an effective, inexpensive route to addressing many of the riskier or more expensive issues associated with the discovery, development and monitoring of drug products.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structure elucidation of unknown small molecules by mass spectrometry is a challenge despite advances in instrumentation. The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures, rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas.RESULTS: An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements, (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, (3) isotopic patterns, (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios, (5) element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68,237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First, 432,968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6{\%} of these compounds did not pass all rules. Next, the rules were shown to effectively reducing the complement all eight billion theoretically possible C, H, N, S, O, P-formulas up to 2000 Da to only 623 million most probable elemental compositions. Thirdly 6,000 pharmaceutical, toxic and natural compounds were selected from DrugBank, TSCA and DNP databases. The correct formulas were retrieved as top hit at 80-99{\%} probability when assuming data acquisition with complete resolution of unique compounds and 5{\%} absolute isotope ratio deviation and 3 ppm mass accuracy. Last, some exemplary compounds were analyzed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry. In each case, the correct formula was ranked as top hit when combining the seven rules with database queries.CONCLUSION: The seven rules enable an automatic exclusion of molecular formulas which are either wrong or which contain unlikely high or low number of elements. The correct molecular formula is assigned with a probability of 98{\%} if the formula exists in a compound database. For truly novel compounds that are not present in databases, the correct formula is found in the first three hits with a probability of 65-81{\%}.

It is frequently used in biomarker identification and the metabolic profiling of cells, tissues or organisms. The data processing challenges in metabolomics are quite unique and often require specialized (or expensive) data analysis software and a detailed knowledge of cheminformatics, bioinformatics and statistics. In an effort to simplify metabolomic data analysis while at the same time improving user accessibility, we have developed a freely accessible, easy-to-use web server for metabolomic data analysis called MetaboAnalyst. Fundamentally, MetaboAnalyst is a web-based metabolomic data processing tool not unlike many of today's web-based microarray analysis packages. It accepts a variety of input data (NMR peak lists, binned spectra, MS peak lists, compound/concentration data) in a wide variety of formats. It also offers a number of options for metabolomic data processing, data normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, graphing, metabolite identification and pathway mapping. In particular, MetaboAnalyst supports such techniques as: fold change analysis, t-tests, PCA, PLS-DA, hierarchical clustering and a number of more sophisticated statistical or machine learning methods. It also employs a large library of reference spectra to facilitate compound identification from most kinds of input spectra. MetaboAnalyst guides users through a step-by-step analysis pipeline using a variety of menus, information hyperlinks and check boxes. Upon completion, the server generates a detailed report describing each method used, embedded with graphical and tabular outputs. MetaboAnalyst is capable of handling most kinds of metabolomic data and was designed to perform most of the common kinds of metabolomic data analyses. MetaboAnalyst is accessible at http://www.metaboanalyst.ca.},

abstract = {MetaboAnalyst (www.metaboanalyst.ca) is a web server designed to permit comprehensive metabolomic data analysis, visualization and interpretation. It supports a wide range of complex statistical calculations and high quality graphical rendering functions that require significant computational resources. First introduced in 2009, MetaboAnalyst has experienced more than a 50X growth in user traffic ({\textgreater}50 000 jobs processed each month). In order to keep up with the rapidly increasing computational demands and a growing number of requests to support translational and systems biology applications, we performed a substantial rewrite and major feature upgrade of the server. The result is MetaboAnalyst 3.0. By completely re-implementing the MetaboAnalyst suite using the latest web framework technologies, we have been able substantially improve its performance, capacity and user interactivity. Three new modules have also been added including: (i) a module for biomarker analysis based on the calculation of receiver operating characteristic curves; (ii) a module for sample size estimation and power analysis for improved planning of metabolomics studies and (iii) a module to support integrative pathway analysis for both genes and metabolites. In addition, popular features found in existing modules have been significantly enhanced by upgrading the graphical output, expanding the compound libraries and by adding support for more diverse organisms.},

abstract = {In the post-genomic era, it has become evident that genetic changes alone are not sufficient to understand most disease processes including pancreatic cancer. Genome sequencing has revealed a complex set of genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer such as point mutations, chromosomal losses, gene amplifications and telomere shortening that drive cancerous growth through specific signaling pathways. Proteome-based approaches are important complements to genomic data and provide crucial information of the target driver molecules and their post-translational modifications. By applying quantitative mass spectrometry, this is an alternative way to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis and personalized medicine. We review the current quantitative mass spectrometric technologies and analyses that have been developed and applied in the last decade in the context of pancreatic cancer. Examples of candidate biomarkers that have been identified from these pancreas studies include among others, asporin, CD9, CXC chemokine ligand 7, fibronectin 1, galectin-1, gelsolin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2, metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, stromal cell derived factor 4, and transforming growth factor beta-induced protein. Many of these proteins are involved in various steps in pancreatic tumor progression including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, metastasis, immune response and angiogenesis. These new protein candidates may provide essential information for the development of protein diagnostics and targeted therapies. We further argue that new strategies must be advanced and established for the integration of proteomic, transcriptomic and genomic data, in order to enhance biomarker translation. Large scale studies with meta data processing will pave the way for novel and unexpected correlations within pancreatic cancer, that will benefit the patient, with targeted treatment.},

abstract = {Renewed interest in metabolic research over the last two decades has inspired an explosion of technological developments for studying metabolism. At the forefront of methodological innovation is an approach referred to as "untargeted" or "discovery" metabolomics. The experimental objective of this technique is to comprehensively measure the entire metabolome, which constitutes a largely undefined set of molecules. Given its potential comprehensive coverage, untargeted metabolomics is often the first choice of experiments for investigators pursuing a metabolic research question. It is important to recognize, however, that untargeted metabolomics may not always be the optimal experimental approach. Conventionally, untargeted metabolomics only provides information about relative differences in metabolite pool sizes. Therefore, depending on the specific scientific question at hand, a complementary approach involving stable isotopes (such as metabolic flux analysis) may be better suited to provide biological insights. Unlike untargeted metabolomics, stable-isotope methods can provide information about differences in reaction rates.},

abstract = {Background: 'Omics' high-throughput analyses, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, are widely applied in human endometrial studies. Analysis of endometrial transcriptome patterns in physiological and pathophysiological conditions has been to date the most commonly applied 'omics' technique in human endometrium. As the technologies improve, proteomics holds the next big promise for this field. The 'omics' technologies have undoubtedly advanced our knowledge of human endometrium in relation to fertility and different diseases. Nevertheless, the challenges arising fromthe vast amount of data generated and the broad variation of 'omics' profiling according to different environments and stimuli make it difficult to assess the validity, reproducibility and interpretation of such 'omics' data.With the expansion of 'omics' analyses in the study of the endometrium, there is a growing need to develop guidelines for the design of studies, and the analysis and interpretation of 'omics' data. methods: Systematic review of the literature in PubMed, and references from relevant articles were investigated up to March 2013. results: The current review aims to provide guidelines for future 'omics' studies on human endometrium, together with a summary of the status and trends, promise and shortcomings in the high-throughput technologies. In addition, the approaches presented here can be adapted to other areas of high-throughput 'omics' studies. conclusion: A highly rigorous approach to future studies, based on the guidelines provided here, is a prerequisite for obtaining data on biological systems which can be shared among researchers worldwide and will ultimately be of clinical benefit. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

The combination of these processes should present the experimental data in an appropriate structure so to identify the biological changes in a valid and robust manner.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: Currently, different researchers apply different data processing methods and no assessment of the permutations applied to UHPLC-MS datasets has been published. Here we wish to define the most appropriate data processing workflow.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We assess the influence of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods on univariate and multivariate analysis of UHPLC-MS datasets acquired for different mammalian samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our studies have shown that once data are filtered, missing values are not correlated with m/z, retention time or response. Following an exhaustive evaluation, we recommend PQN normalisation with no missing value imputation and no transformation or scaling for univariate analysis. For PCA we recommend applying PQN normalisation with Random Forest missing value imputation, glog transformation and no scaling method. For PLS-DA we recommend PQN normalisation, KNN as the missing value imputation method, generalised logarithm transformation and no scaling. These recommendations are based on searching for the biologically important metabolite features independent of their measured abundance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The appropriate choice of normalisation, missing value imputation, transformation and scaling methods differs depending on the data analysis method and the choice of method is essential to maximise the biological derivations from UHPLC-MS datasets.},

abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) is widely used in metabolomics due to its sensitivity, reproducibility, speed and versatility. Metabolites are detected as peaks which are characterised by mass-over-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time (rt), and one of the most critical but also the most challenging tasks in metabolomics is to annotate the large number of peaks detected in biological samples. Accurate m/z measurements enable the prediction of molecular formulae which provide clues to the chemical identity of peaks, but often a number of metabolites have identical molecular formulae. Chromatographic behaviour, reflecting the physicochemical properties of metabolites, should also provide structural information. However, the variation in rt between analytical runs, and the complicating factors underlying the observed time shifts, make the use of such information for peak annotation a non-trivial task. To this end, we conducted Quantitative Structure–Retention Relationship (QSRR) modelling between the calculated molecular descriptors (MDs) and the experimental retention times (rts) of 93 authentic compounds analysed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to high resolution MS. A predictive QSRR model based on Random Forests algorithm outperformed a Multiple Linear Regression based model, and achieved a high correlation between predicted rts and experimental rts (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.97), with mean and median absolute error of 0.52 min and 0.34 min (corresponding to 5.1 and 3.2 {\%} error), respectively. We demonstrate that rt prediction with the precision achieved enables the systematic utilisation of rts for annotating unknown peaks detected in a metabolomics study. The application of the QSRR model with the strategy we outlined enhanced the peak annotation process by reducing the number of false positives resulting from database queries by matching accurate mass alone, and enriching the reference library. The predicted rts were validated using either authentic compounds or ion fragmentation patterns.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean diet (MD) is considered a dietary pattern with beneficial effects on human health. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of an MD on urinary metabolome by comparing subjects at 1 and 3 years of follow-up, after an MD supplemented with either extra-virgin olive oil (MD + EVOO) or nuts (MD + Nuts), to those on advice to follow a control low-fat diet (LFD). Ninety-eight nondiabetic volunteers were evaluated, using metabolomic approaches, corresponding to MD + EVOO (n = 41), MD + Nuts (n = 27), or LFD (n = 30) groups. The (1)H NMR urinary profiles were examined at baseline and after 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Multivariate data analysis (OSC-PLS-DA and HCA) methods were used to identify the potential biomarker discriminating groups, exhibiting a urinary metabolome separation between MD groups against baseline and LFD. Results revealed that the most prominent hallmarks concerning MD groups were related to the metabolism of carbohydrates (3-hydroxybutyrate, citrate, and cis-aconitate), creatine, creatinine, amino acids (proline, N-acetylglutamine, glycine, branched-chain amino acids, and derived metabolites), lipids (oleic and suberic acids), and microbial cometabolites (phenylacetylglutamine and p-cresol). Otherwise, hippurate, trimethylamine-N-oxide, histidine and derivates (methylhistidines, carnosine, and anserine), and xanthosine were predominant after LFD. The application of NMR-based metabolomics enabled the classification of individuals regarding their dietary pattern and highlights the potential of this approach for evaluating changes in the urinary metabolome at different time points of follow-up in response to specific dietary interventions.},

We used 24-hour urinary metabolic profiling by proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ion exchange chromatography to characterize the metabolic signatures of adiposity in the U.S. (n = 1880) and UK (n = 444) cohorts of the INTERMAP (International Study of Macro- and Micronutrients and Blood Pressure) epidemiologic study. Metabolic profiling of urine samples collected over two 24-hour time periods 3 weeks apart showed reproducible patterns of metabolite excretion associated with adiposity. Exploratory analysis of the urinary metabolome using 1H NMR spectroscopy of the U.S. samples identified 29 molecular species, clustered in interconnecting metabolic pathways, that were significantly associated (P = 1.5 × 10−5 to 2.0 × 10−36) with body mass index (BMI); 25 of these species were also found in the UK validation cohort. We found multiple associations between urinary metabolites and BMI including urinary glycoproteins and N-acetyl neuraminate (related to renal function), trimethylamine, dimethylamine, 4-cresyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (gut microbial co-metabolites), succinate and citrate (tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates), ketoleucine and the ketoleucine/leucine ratio (linked to skeletal muscle mitochondria and branched-chain amino acid metabolism), ethanolamine (skeletal muscle turnover), and 3-methylhistidine (skeletal muscle turnover and meat intake).

We examined the vaginal microbiome in two cohorts of women who experienced normal term births: a cross-sectionally sampled cohort of 613 pregnant and 1,969 non-pregnant women, focusing on 300 pregnant and 300 non-pregnant women of African, Hispanic or European ancestry case-matched for race, gestational age and household income; and a longitudinally sampled cohort of 90 pregnant women of African or non-African ancestry. In these women, the vaginal microbiome shifted during pregnancy toward Lactobacillus-dominated profiles at the expense of taxa often associated with vaginal dysbiosis. The shifts occurred early in pregnancy, followed predictable patterns, were associated with simplification of the metabolic capacity of the microbiome and were significant only in women of African or Hispanic ancestry. Both genomic and environmental factors are likely contributors to these trends, with socioeconomic status as a likely environmental influence.},

For both rare neuromuscular and mitochondrial disorders, its application has improved diagnostic rates. However, the generalizability of this approach to diverse Mendelian diseases has yet to be evaluated. We sequenced whole blood RNA from 56 cases with undiagnosed rare diseases spanning 11 diverse disease categories to evaluate the general application of RNA-seq to Mendelian disease diagnosis. We developed a robust approach to compare rare disease cases to existing large sets of RNA-seq controls (N=1,594 external and N=31 family-based controls) and demonstrated the substantial impacts of gene and variant filtering strategies on disease gene identification when combined with RNA-seq. Across our cohort, we observed that RNA-seq yields a 8.5{\%} diagnostic rate. These diagnoses included diseases where blood would not intuitively reflect evidence of disease. We identified RARS2 as an under-expression outlier containing compound heterozygous pathogenic variants for an individual exhibiting profound global developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly, hypotonia, and progressive scoliosis. We also identified a new splicing junction in KCTD7 for an individual with global developmental delay, loss of milestones, tremors and seizures. Our study provides a broad evaluation of blood RNA-seq for the diagnosis of rare disease.},

abstract = {There is no consensus for a blood-based test for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Expression profiling of small non-coding RNA's, microRNA (miRNA), has revealed diagnostic potential in human diseases. Circulating miRNA are found in small vesicles known as exosomes within biological fluids such as human serum. The aim of this work was to determine a set of differential exosomal miRNA biomarkers between healthy and AD patients, which may aid in diagnosis. Using next-generation deep sequencing, we profiled exosomal miRNA from serum (N=49) collected from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study (AIBL). Sequencing results were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; N=60), with predictions performed using the Random Forest method. Additional risk factors collected during the 4.5-year AIBL Study including clinical, medical and cognitive assessments, and amyloid neuroimaging with positron emission tomography were assessed. An AD-specific 16-miRNA signature was selected and adding established risk factors including age, sex and apolipoprotein ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4) allele status to the panel of deregulated miRNA resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 87{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively, for predicting AD. Furthermore, amyloid neuroimaging information for those healthy control subjects incorrectly classified with AD-suggested progression in these participants towards AD. These data suggest that an exosomal miRNA signature may have potential to be developed as a suitable peripheral screening tool for AD.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 28 October 2014; doi:10.1038/mp.2014.127.},

abstract = {Discovery of biomarkers in peripheral blood is a crucial step toward the early diagnosis and repetitive monitoring of treatment response for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metabolomics is a promising technology that can identify unbiased biomarkers. To explore potential blood biomarkers for AD via metabolic profiling with high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, we identified changes in peripheral blood metabolomic profiles in response to amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-induced neuroinflammation and co-treatment with gallate, a phytochemical known to have anti-neuroinflammatory properties. Alzheimer's-like (AL) model mice were produced by intracerebroventricular infusion of A$\beta$ and compared with normal control mice with infusion of vehicle. AL mice were treated with either gallate (treated AL mice) or vehicle (untreated AL mice). Metabolomic analyses of both whole blood and plasma showed a clear separation between untreated AL mice and the other two groups, with levels of several metabolites involved in energy metabolism, including pyruvate and creatine, being significantly reduced in untreated AL mice compared with control and treated AL mice. Gallate treatment suppressed A$\beta$-induced overproduction of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ in the hippocampus and normalized plasma levels of the affected metabolites. These results suggest that plasma levels of several metabolites could be indicative of both brain pathology and therapeutic responses, supporting the possibility of a close relationship between central neuroinflammation and systemic metabolic disturbance. These findings also suggest the potential of NMR-based metabolomics as a method to identify novel plasma biomarkers for AD, which could be confirmed by future translational research with human patients.},

We describe the Continuous Individualized Risk Index (CIRI), a method to dynamically determine outcome probabilities for individual patients utilizing risk predictors acquired over time. Similar to "win probability" models in other fields, CIRI provides a real-time probability by integrating risk assessments throughout a patient's course. Applying CIRI to patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, we demonstrate improved outcome prediction compared to conventional risk models. We demonstrate CIRI's broader utility in analogous models of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast adenocarcinoma and perform a proof-of-concept analysis demonstrating how CIRI could be used to develop predictive biomarkers for therapy selection. We envision that dynamic risk assessment will facilitate personalized medicine and enable innovative therapeutic paradigms.},

With the aim to obtain wide metabolome coverage two different chromatographic separation modes, namely reversed phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), were used. RP/UHPLC-MS and HILIC/UHPLC-MS methods were optimized and applied to analyze CSF samples from 75 patients related to AD progression. Significant metabolic differences in CSF samples from subjects with different cognitive status related to AD progression were detected using this methodology, obtaining a group of potential biomarkers together with a classification model by means of a multivariate statistical analysis. The proposed model predicted the development of AD with an accuracy of 98.7{\%} and specificity and sensitivity values above of 95{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this context, liquid-chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) is increasingly used and, via untargeted data-dependent MS/MS experiments, massive amounts of detailed information on the chemical composition of crude extracts can be generated. An efficient exploitation of such data sets requires automated data treatment and access to dedicated fragmentation databases. Various novel bioinformatics approaches such as molecular networking (MN) and in-silico fragmentation tools have emerged recently and provide new perspective for early metabolite identification in natural products (NPs) research. Here we propose an innovative dereplication strategy based on the combination of MN with an extensive in-silico MS/MS fragmentation database of NPs. Using two case studies, we demonstrate that this combined approach offers a powerful tool to navigate through the chemistry of complex NPs extracts, dereplicate metabolites, and annotate analogues of database entries. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society.},

A pragmatic approach combining several well-established statistical methods was developed for processing this large data set in order to detect small differences in metabolic profiles in combination with a large biological variation. Such metabolomics studies require a careful analytical and statistical protocol. The strategy included data preprocessing, data analysis, and validation of statistical models. After several data preprocessing steps, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for finding biomarkers. To validate the found biomarkers statistically, the PLS-DA models were validated by means of a permutation test, biomarker models, and noninformative models. Univariate plots of potential biomarkers were used to obtain insight in up- or downregulation. The strategy proposed proved to be applicable for dealing with large-scale human metabolomics studies.},

abstract = {Inflammatory processes and other failures related to the immune system are common features associated with Alzheimer's disease, in both brain and the peripheral system. Thus, the study of the main organs of the immune system may have a great potential for the elucidation of pathological mechanisms underlying these abnormalities. This is the first metabolomic investigation performed in spleen and thymus from transgenic mice of Alzheimer's disease. Tissues were fingerprinted using a metabolomic platform comprising gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistics demonstrated significant differences in numerous metabolites between the APP/PS1 mice and wild type controls, and it was proven that multiple biochemical pathways are disturbed in these organs including abnormal metabolism of phospholipids, energy deficiencies, altered homeostasis of amino acids, oxidative stress, and others. Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of the proper metabolic functioning of peripheral immune system in the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

abstract = {Natural products (NPs) research is changing and rapidly adopting cutting-edge tools, which radically transform the way to characterize extracts and small molecules. With the innovations in metabolomics, early integration of deep metabolome annotation information allows to efficiently guide the isolation of valuable NPs only and, in parallel, to generate massive metadata sets for the study of given extracts under various perspectives. This is the case for chemotaxonomy studies where common biosynthetic traits among species can be evidenced, but also for drug discovery purpose where such traits, in combination with bioactivity studies on extracts, may evidence bioactive molecules even before their isolation. One of the major bottlenecks of such studies remains the level of accuracy at which NPs can be identified. We discuss here the advancements in LC–MS and associated mining methods by addressing what would be ideal and what is achieved today. We propose future developments for reinforcing generic NPs databases both in the spectral and structural dimensions by heading towards a virtuous metabolite identification cycle allowing annotation of both known and unreported metabolites in an iterative manner. Such approaches could significantly accelerate and improve our knowledge of the huge chemodiversity found in nature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ideally, disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD) will be applied during the 'preclinical' stage (pathology present with cognition intact) before severe neuronal damage occurs, or upon recognizing very mild cognitive impairment. Developing and judiciously administering such therapies will require biomarker panels to identify early AD pathology, classify disease stage, monitor pathological progression, and predict cognitive decline. To discover such biomarkers, we measured AD-associated changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: CSF samples from individuals with mild AD (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 1) (n = 24) and cognitively normal controls (CDR 0) (n = 24) were subjected to two-dimensional difference-in-gel electrophoresis. Within 119 differentially-abundant gel features, mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified 47 proteins. For validation, eleven proteins were re-evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Six of these assays (NrCAM, YKL-40, chromogranin A, carnosinase I, transthyretin, cystatin C) distinguished CDR 1 and CDR 0 groups and were subsequently applied (with tau, p-tau181 and A$\beta$42 ELISAs) to a larger independent cohort (n = 292) that included individuals with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses using stepwise logistic regression yielded optimal biomarker combinations to distinguish CDR 0 from CDR{\textgreater}0 (tau, YKL-40, NrCAM) and CDR 1 from CDR{\textless}1 (tau, chromogranin A, carnosinase I) with areas under the curve of 0.90 (0.85-0.94 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]) and 0.88 (0.81-0.94 CI), respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Four novel CSF biomarkers for AD (NrCAM, YKL-40, chromogranin A, carnosinase I) can improve the diagnostic accuracy of A$\beta$42 and tau. Together, these six markers describe six clinicopathological stages from cognitive normalcy to mild dementia, including stages defined by increased risk of cognitive decline. Such a panel might improve clinical trial efficiency by guiding subject enrollment and monitoring disease progression. Further studies will be required to validate this panel and evaluate its potential for distinguishing AD from other dementing conditions.},

abstract = {Since this Phase I trial was based on a strategy of biochemical modulation, namely, the inhibition of nucleoside uptake by dipyridamole, a biochemical assessment of the actions of acivicin and dipyridamole was undertaken in order to aid our interpretation of the clinical findings. The primary biochemical objectives of this trial were: (a) to determine whether plasma levels of dipyridamole sufficient to inhibit nucleoside uptake could be achieved with a 72-h continuous i.v. infusion; (b) to monitor the effects of acivicin on two key enzymatic targets, CTP synthetase and GMP synthetase; and (c) to evaluate changes in cellular ribonucleoside triphosphate pools during therapy. Since peripheral blood mononuclear cells have relevant biochemical targets and can be serially obtained during the course of therapy, the biochemical effects of acivicin and dipyridamole were determined in these cells. At the maximally tolerated dose of dipyridamole (23.1 mg/kg/72 h), the steady-state concentrations of total and free dipyridamole averaged 11.9 microM and 27.8 nM, respectively. These levels were sufficient to inhibit cytidine (1 microM) uptake by greater than 50{\%} in the lymphocytes of five of six patients so treated. Using lymphocytes obtained from 14 normal volunteers the concentration of free dipyridamole needed to inhibit the uptake of 1 microM cytidine by 50{\%} averaged 13.8 +/- 1.1 nM. The plasma levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, which tightly binds dipyridamole, ranged from 60 to 300 mg/dl in the patients in this study. As a consequence there were wide variations in the percentage of dipyridamole present as the unbound, pharmacologically active form and in the rates of dipyridamole clearance. The decreased rate of dipyridamole clearance seen in patients with high levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein resulted in higher plasma concentrations of total dipyridamole and compensated for the reduced fraction of free drug. Therefore, the plasma concentration of free dipyridamole varied much less than the total drug concentration in these patients. CTP synthetase and GMP synthetase activities were measured in patients' peripheral mononuclear cells prior to and at various times during therapy. CTP synthetase activity was inhibited in a time-dependent fashion by greater than 75{\%} in seven of 13 evaluable courses; GMP synthetase was similarly inhibited in only three of ten cases. Ribonucleoside triphosphate pools were also measured in the patient's lymphocytes. CTP pool reductions of 30 to 50{\%} were seen in nine of 19 courses, but in only four cases was the inhibition greater than 50{\%}.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Using mass spectrometry, we measured the consumption and release (CORE) profiles of 219 metabolites from media across the NCI-60 cancer cell lines, and integrated these data with a preexisting atlas of gene expression. This analysis identified glycine consumption and expression of the mitochondrial glycine biosynthetic pathway as strongly correlated with rates of proliferation across cancer cells. Antagonizing glycine uptake and its mitochondrial biosynthesis preferentially impaired rapidly proliferating cells. Moreover, higher expression of this pathway was associated with greater mortality in breast cancer patients.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a cognitive disorder with a number of complex neuropathologies, including, but not limited to, neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, neuronal shrinkage, hypomyelination, neuroinflammation and cholinergic dysfunction. The role of underlying pathological processes in the evolution of the cholinergic deficit responsible for cognitive decline has not been elucidated. Furthermore, generation of testable hypotheses for defining points of pharmacological intervention in AD are complicated by the large scale occurrence of older individuals dying with no cognitive impairment despite having a high burden of AD pathology (plaques and tangles). To further complicate these research challenges, there is no animal model that reproduces the combined hallmark neuropathologies of AD. These research limitations have stimulated the application of 'omics' technologies in AD research with the goals of defining biologic markers of disease and disease progression and uncovering potential points of pharmacological intervention for the design of AD therapeutics. In the case of sporadic AD, the dominant form of dementia, genomics has revealed that the $\epsilon$4 allele of apolipoprotein E, a lipid transport/chaperone protein, is a susceptibility factor. This seminal observation points to the importance of lipid dynamics as an area of investigation in AD. In this regard, lipidomics studies have demonstrated that there are major deficits in brain structural glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, as well as alterations in metabolites of these complex structural lipids, which act as signaling molecules. Peroxisomal dysfunction appears to be a key component of the changes in glycerophospholipid deficits. In this review, lipid alterations and their potential roles in the pathophysiology of AD are discussed.},

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances of taking the right decision on a successful treatment plan. The Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems are applied widely in the detection and differential diagnosis of many different kinds of abnormalities. Therefore, improving the accuracy of a CAD system has become one of the major research areas. In this paper, a CAD scheme for detection of breast cancer has been developed using deep belief network unsupervised path followed by back propagation supervised path. The construction is back-propagation neural network with Liebenberg Marquardt learning function while weights are initialized from the deep belief network path (DBN-NN). Our technique was tested on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The classifier complex gives an accuracy of 99.68{\%} indicating promising results over previously-published studies. The proposed system provides an effective classification model for breast cancer. In addition, we examined the architecture at several train-test partitions.},

abstract = {Improved analytical technologies and data extraction algorithms enable detection of {\textgreater}10 000 reproducible signals by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, creating a bottleneck in chemical identification. In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. MS/MS evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using xMSannotator in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80{\%} of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the xMSannotator annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, xMSannotator, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as ChemSpider, KEGG, HMDB, T3DB, and LipidMaps.},

In this study, a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry is used to investigate serum metabolic characteristics of PCOS. PCOS women and healthy control can be clustered into two distinct groups based on multivariate statistical analysis. Significant increase in the levels of unsaturated free fatty acids, fatty acid amides, sulfated steroids, glycated amino acid and the decrease in levels of lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, etc., were found. These metabolites showed abnormalities of lipid- and androgen-metabolism, increase of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity and accumulation of advanced glycation end-products in PCOS patients. On the basis of the binary logistic regression model, free fatty acid (FFA) 18:1/FFA 18:0, FFA 20:3, dihydrotestosterone sulfate, glycated phenylalanine, and uridine were combined as a diagnostic biomarker. The area under the curve (AUC) of combinational biomarker was 0.839 in 131 discovery phase samples and 0.874 in 109 validation phase samples.

However, their system-level analysis has been limited owing to challenges in global metabolite identification. Most metabolite features detected by untargeted metabolomics carried out by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry cannot be uniquely identified without additional, time-consuming experiments. We report a network-based approach, prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics (PIUMet), that infers molecular pathways and components via integrative analysis of metabolite features, without requiring their identification. We demonstrated PIUMet by analyzing changes in metabolism of sphingolipids, fatty acids and steroids in a Huntington's disease model. Additionally, PIUMet enabled us to elucidate putative identities of altered metabolite features in diseased cells, and infer experimentally undetected, disease-associated metabolites and dysregulated proteins. Finally, we established PIUMet's ability for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics data with proteomics data, demonstrating that this approach elicits disease-associated metabolites and proteins that cannot be inferred by individual analysis of these data.},

abstract = {The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of in silico predictions. One of the challenges of in silico annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of in silico predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve in silico annotations. The Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) tool is accessible through the GNPS web-platform https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a growing health problem, but little is known about its early disease stages, its effects on biological processes or the transition to clinical T2D. To understand the earliest stages of T2D better, we obtained samples from 106 healthy individuals and individuals with prediabetes over approximately four years and performed deep profiling of transcriptomes, metabolomes, cytokines, and proteomes, as well as changes in the microbiome. This rich longitudinal data set revealed many insights: first, healthy profiles are distinct among individuals while displaying diverse patterns of intra- and/or inter-personal variability. Second, extensive host and microbial changes occur during respiratory viral infections and immunization, and immunization triggers potentially protective responses that are distinct from responses to respiratory viral infections. Moreover, during respiratory viral infections, insulin-resistant participants respond differently than insulin-sensitive participants. Third, global co-association analyses among the thousands of profiled molecules reveal specific host–microbe interactions that differ between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive individuals. Last, we identified early personal molecular signatures in one individual that preceded the onset of T2D, including the inflammation markers interleukin-1 receptor agonist (IL-1RA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) paired with xenobiotic-induced immune signalling. Our study reveals insights into pathways and responses that differ between glucose-dysregulated and healthy individuals during health and disease and provides an open-access data resource to enable further research into healthy, prediabetic and T2D states.},

We developed a sensitive method to monitor personal airborne biological and chemical exposures and followed the personal exposomes of 15 individuals for up to 890 days and over 66 distinct geographical locations. We found that individuals are potentially exposed to thousands of pan-domain species and chemical compounds, including insecticides and carcinogens. Personal biological and chemical exposomes are highly dynamic and vary spatiotemporally, even for individuals located in the same general geographical region. Integrated analysis of biological and chemical exposomes revealed strong location-dependent relationships. Finally, construction of an exposome interaction network demonstrated the presence of distinct yet interconnected human- and environment-centric clouds, comprised of interacting ecosystems such as human, flora, pets, and arthropods. Overall, we demonstrate that human exposomes are diverse, dynamic, spatiotemporally-driven interaction networks with the potential to impact human health.

A (1)H NMR spectroscopy-based metabolome-wide association approach was used to identify urinary metabolites that discriminate between southern and northern Chinese population samples, to investigate population biomarkers that might relate to the difference in cardiovascular disease risk. NMR spectra were acquired from two 24-h urine specimens per person for 523 northern and 244 southern Chinese participants in the INTERMAP Study of macro/micronutrients and blood pressure. Discriminating metabolites were identified using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis and assessed for statistical significance with conservative family wise error rate {\textless} 0.01 to minimize false positive findings. Urinary metabolites significantly (P {\textless} 1.2 × 10(-16) to 2.9 × 10(-69)) higher in northern than southern Chinese populations included dimethylglycine, alanine, lactate, branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine), N-acetyls of glycoprotein fragments (including uromodulin), N-acetyl neuraminic acid, pentanoic/heptanoic acid, and methylguanidine; metabolites significantly (P {\textless} 1.1 × 10(-12) to 2 × 10(-127)) higher in the south were gut microbial cometabolites (hippurate, 4-cresyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate), succinate, creatine, scyllo-inositol, prolinebetaine, and trans-aconitate.

abstract = {Summary Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. Video Abstract},

Dividing the entire data set into training and test sets resulted in a median correlation between predicted and true biomass of 0.58. The demonstrated high predictive power of metabolic composition for biomass features this composite measure as an excellent biomarker and opens new opportunities to enhance plant breeding specifically in the context of renewable resources.},

abstract = {Numerous genes and molecular pathways are implicated in neurodegenerative proteinopathies, but their inter-relationships are poorly understood. We systematically mapped molecular pathways underlying the toxicity of alpha-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn), a protein central to Parkinson's disease. Genome-wide screens in yeast identified 332 genes that impact $\alpha$-syn toxicity. To “humanize” this molecular network, we developed a computational method, TransposeNet. This integrates a Steiner prize-collecting approach with homology assignment through sequence, structure, and interaction topology. TransposeNet linked $\alpha$-syn to multiple parkinsonism genes and druggable targets through perturbed protein trafficking and ER quality control as well as mRNA metabolism and translation. A calcium signaling hub linked these processes to perturbed mitochondrial quality control and function, metal ion transport, transcriptional regulation, and signal transduction. Parkinsonism gene interaction profiles spatially opposed in the network (ATP13A2/PARK9 and VPS35/PARK17) were highly distinct, and network relationships for specific genes (LRRK2/PARK8, ATXN2, and EIF4G1/PARK18) were confirmed in patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. This cross-species platform connected diverse neurodegenerative genes to proteinopathy through specific mechanisms and may facilitate patient stratification for targeted therapy.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Batch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry (MS) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. OBJECTIVES This paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects. METHODS Batch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples (QCs), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large LC-MS and GC-MS data sets of samples from Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS The three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough QCs are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects-replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered. CONCLUSION The use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough QCs are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.},

abstract = {LC–MS based global metabolite profiling cur-rently lacks detailed guidelines to demonstrate that the obtained data is of high enough analytical quality. Insuf-ficient data quality may result in the failure to generate a hypothesis, or in the worst case, a false or skewed hypothesis. After assessing the literature, it is apparent that an analytically focused summary and critical discussion related to this subject would be beneficial for both begin-ners and experts engaged in this field. A particular focus will be placed on data quality, which we here define as the degree to which a set of parameters fulfills predetermined criteria, similar to the established guidelines for targeted analysis. However, several of these parameters are difficult to assess since holistic approaches measure thousands of metabolites in parallel and seldom include predefined knowledge of which metabolites will differ between sam-ple groups. In this review, the following parameters will be discussed in detail: reproducibility, selectivity, certainty of metabolite identification and metabolite coverage. The review systematically describes the generic workflow for LC–MS based global metabolite profiling and highlights how each separate part may affect data quality. The last part of the review describes how data quality can be evaluated as well as identifies areas where additional improvement is needed. In this review, we provide our own analytical opinions in regards to evaluation and, to some extent, improvement of data quality.},

abstract = {Untargeted liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis of human biospecimens has become among the most promising strategies for probing the underpinnings of human health and disease. Analysis of spectral data across population scale cohorts, however, is precluded by day-to-day nonlinear signal drifts in LC retention time or batch effects that complicate comparison of thousands of untargeted peaks. To date, there exists no efficient means of visualization and quantitative assessment of signal drift, correction of drift when present, and automated filtering of unstable spectral features, particularly across thousands of data files in population scale experiments. Herein, we report the development of a set of R-based scripts that allow for pre- and postprocessing of raw LC-MS data. These methods can be integrated with existing data analysis workflows by providing initial preprocessing bulk nonlinear retention time correction at the raw data level. Further, this approach provides postprocessing visualization and quantification of peak alignment accuracy, as well as peak-reliability-based parsing of processed data through hierarchical clustering of signal profiles. In a metabolomics data set derived from ∼3000 human plasma samples, we find that application of our alignment tools resulted in substantial improvement in peak alignment accuracy, automated data filtering, and ultimately statistical power for detection of metabolite correlates of clinical measures. These tools will enable metabolomics studies of population scale cohorts.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reducing premature mortality associated with age-related chronic diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, is an urgent priority. We report early results using genomics in combination with advanced imaging and other clinical testing to proactively screen for age-related chronic disease risk among adults. We enrolled active, symptom-free adults in a study of screening for age-related chronic diseases associated with premature mortality. In addition to personal and family medical history and other clinical testing, we obtained whole-genome sequencing (WGS), noncontrast whole-body MRI, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), global metabolomics, a new blood test for prediabetes (Quantose IR), echocardiography (ECHO), ECG, and cardiac rhythm monitoring to identify age-related chronic disease risks. Precision medicine screening using WGS and advanced imaging along with other testing among active, symptom-free adults identified a broad set of complementary age-related chronic disease risks associated with premature mortality and strengthened WGS variant interpretation. This and other similarly designed screening approaches anchored by WGS and advanced imaging may have the potential to extend healthy life among active adults through improved prevention and early detection of age-related chronic diseases (and their risk factors) associated with premature mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Missing values in mass spectrometry metabolomic datasets occur widely and can originate from a number of sources, including for both technical and biological reasons. Currently, little is known about these data, i.e. about their distributions across datasets, the need (or not) to consider them in the data processing pipeline, and most importantly, the optimal way of assigning them values prior to univariate or multivariate data analysis. Here, we address all of these issues using direct infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data. We have shown that missing data are widespread, accounting for ca. 20{\%} of data and affecting up to 80{\%} of all variables, and that they do not occur randomly but rather as a function of signal intensity and mass-to-charge ratio. We have demonstrated that missing data estimation algorithms have a major effect on the outcome of data analysis when comparing the differences between biological sample groups, including by t test, ANOVA and principal component analysis. Furthermore, results varied significantly across the eight algorithms that we assessed for their ability to impute known, but labelled as missing, entries. Based on all of our findings we identified the k-nearest neighbour imputation method (KNN) as the optimal missing value estimation approach for our direct infusion mass spectrometry datasets. However, we believe the wider significance of this study is that it highlights the importance of missing metabolite levels in the data processing pipeline and offers an approach to identify optimal ways of treating missing data in metabolomics experiments.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence has shown that abnormal metabolic phenotypes in body fluids reflect the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). These body fluids include urine; however, the relationship between, specifically, urinary metabolic phenotypes and PD is not fully understood. In this study, urinary metabolites from a total of 401 clinical urine samples collected from 106 idiopathic PD patients and 104 normal control subjects were profiled by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Our study revealed significant correlation between clinical phenotype and urinary metabolite profile. Metabolic profiles of idiopathic PD patients differed significantly and consistently from normal controls, with related metabolic pathway variations observed in steroidogenesis, fatty acid beta-oxidation, histidine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the alteration of the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan metabolism corresponded with pathogenic changes in the alpha-synuclein overexpressed Drosophila model of PD. The results suggest that LC-MS-based urinary metabolomic profiling can reveal the metabolite signatures and related variations in metabolic pathways that characterize PD. Consistent PD-related changes across species may provide the basis for understanding metabolic regulation of PD at the molecular level.},

@article{Tsugawa2016,
abstract = {Compound identification from accurate mass MS/MS spectra is a bottleneck for untargeted metabolomics. In this study, we propose nine rules of hydrogen rearrangement (HR) during bond cleavages in low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID). These rules are based on the classic even-electron rule and cover heteroatoms and multi-stage fragmentation. We evaluated our HR rules by the statistics of MassBank MS/MS spectra in addition to enthalpy calculations, yielding three levels of computational MS/MS annotation: 'resolved' (regular HR behavior following HR rules), 'semi-resolved' (irregular HR behavior), and 'formula-assigned' (lacking structure assignment). With this nomenclature, 78.4{\%} of total 18,506 MS/MS fragment ions in the MassBank database and 84.8{\%} of total 36,370 MS/MS fragment ions in the GNPS database were (semi-) resolved by predicted bond cleavages. We also introduce the MS-FINDER software for structure elucidation. Molecular formulas of precursor ions are determined from accurate mass, isotope ratio, and product ion information. All isomer structures of the predicted formula are retrieved from metabolome databases and MS/MS fragmentations are predicted in silico. The structures are ranked by a combined weighting score considering bond dissociation energies, mass accuracies, fragment linkages and, most importantly, nine HR rules. The program was validated by its ability to correctly calculate molecular formulas with 98.0{\%} accuracy for 5,063 MassBank MS/MS records, and to yield the correct structural isomer with 82.1{\%} accuracy within the top-3 candidates. In a test with 936 manually identified spectra from an untargeted HILIC-QTOF MS data set of human plasma, formulas were correctly predicted in 90.4{\%} of the cases, and the correct isomer structure was retrieved at 80.4{\%} probability within the top-3 candidates, including for compounds that were absent in mass spectral libraries. The MS-FINDER software is freely available at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/.},

abstract = {We performed unbiased analysis of steroid-related compounds to identify novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers using liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectroscopy. The analysis revealed that desmosterol was found to be decreased in AD plasma versus controls. To precisely quantify variations in desmosterol, we established an analytical method to measure desmosterol and cholesterol. Using this LC-based method, we discovered that desmosterol and the desmosterol/cholesterol ratio are significantly decreased in AD. Finally, the validation of this assay using 109 clinical samples confirmed the decrease of desmosterol in AD as well as a change in the desmosterol/cholesterol ratio in AD. Interestingly, we could also observe a difference between mild cognitive impairment and control. In addition, the decrease of desmosterol was somewhat more significant in females. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis between controls and AD, using plasma desmosterol shows a score of 0.80, indicating a good discrimination power for this marker in the two reference populations and confirms the potential usefulness of measuring plasma desmosterol levels for diagnosing AD. Further analysis showed a significant correlation of plasma desmosterol with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Although larger sample populations will be needed to confirm this diagnostic marker sensitivity, our studies demonstrate a sensitive and accurate method of detecting plasma desmosterol concentration and suggest that plasma desmosterol could become a powerful new specific biomarker for early and easy AD diagnosis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION The field of metabolomics has expanded greatly over the past two decades, both as an experimental science with applications in many areas, as well as in regards to data standards and bioinformatics software tools. The diversity of experimental designs and instrumental technologies used for metabolomics has led to the need for distinct data analysis methods and the development of many software tools. OBJECTIVES To compile a comprehensive list of the most widely used freely available software and tools that are used primarily in metabolomics. METHODS The most widely used tools were selected for inclusion in the review by either ≥ 50 citations on Web of Science (as of 08/09/16) or the use of the tool being reported in the recent Metabolomics Society survey. Tools were then categorised by the type of instrumental data (i.e. LC-MS, GC-MS or NMR) and the functionality (i.e. pre- and post-processing, statistical analysis, workflow and other functions) they are designed for. RESULTS A comprehensive list of the most used tools was compiled. Each tool is discussed within the context of its application domain and in relation to comparable tools of the same domain. An extended list including additional tools is available at https://github.com/RASpicer/MetabolomicsTools which is classified and searchable via a simple controlled vocabulary. CONCLUSION This review presents the most widely used tools for metabolomics analysis, categorised based on their main functionality. As future work, we suggest a direct comparison of tools' abilities to perform specific data analysis tasks e.g. peak picking.},

We performed metabolomic profiling on 138 matched clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)/normal tissue pairs and found that ccRCC is characterized by broad shifts in central carbon metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, and antioxidant response. Tumor progression and metastasis were associated with metabolite increases in glutathione and cysteine/methionine metabolism pathways. We develop an analytic pipeline and visualization tool (metabolograms) to bridge the gap between TCGA transcriptomic profiling and our metabolomic data, which enables us to assemble an integrated pathway-level metabolic atlas and to demonstrate discordance between transcriptome and metabolome. Lastly, expression profiling was performed on a high-glutathione cluster, which corresponds to a poor-survival subgroup in the ccRCC TCGA cohort. Using metabolomic profiling, Ari Hakimi et al. show that clear cell renal cell carcinoma is characterized by broad shifts in central carbon metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, and antioxidant response. They also develop metabolograms to allow integrating the TCGA transcriptomic data with their metabolomic data.},

abstract = {Cancer is a devastating disease that alters the metabolism of a cell and the surrounding milieu. Metabolomics is a growing and powerful technology capable of detecting hundreds to thousands of metabolites in tissues and biofluids. The recent advances in metabolomics technologies have enabled a deeper investigation into the metabolism of cancer and a better understanding of how cancer cells use glycolysis, known as the “Warburg effect,” advantageously to produce the amino acids, nucleotides and lipids necessary for tumor proliferation and vascularization. Currently, metabolomics research is being used to discover diagnostic cancer biomarkers in the clinic, to better understand its complex heterogeneous nature, to discover pathways involved in cancer that could be used for new targets and to monitor metabolic biomarkers during therapeutic intervention. These metabolomics approaches may also provide clues to personalized cancer treatments by providing useful information to the clinician about the cancer patient's response to medical interventions.},

abstract = {With recent advances in mass spectrometry, there is an increased interest in data-independent acquisition (DIA) techniques for metabolomics. With DIA technique, all metabolite ions are sequentially selected and isolated using a wide window to generate multiplexed MS/MS spectra. Therefore, DIA strategy enables a continuous and unbiased acquisition of all metabolites and increases the data dimensionality, but presents a challenge to data analysis due to the loss of the direct link between precursor ion and fragment ions. However, very few DIA data processing methods are developed for metabolomics application. Here, we developed a new DIA data analysis approach, namely, MetDIA, for targeted extraction of metabolites from multiplexed MS/MS spectra generated using DIA technique. MetDIA approach considers each metabolite in the spectral library as an analysis target. Ion chromatograms for each metabolite (both precursor ion and fragment ions) and MS2 spectra are readily detected, extracted, and scored for metabolite identification, referred as metabolite-centric identification. A minimum metabolite-centric identification score responsible for 1{\%} false positive rate of identification is determined as 0.8 using fully 13C labeled biological extracts. Finally, the comparisons of our MetDIA method with data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method demonstrated that MetDIA could significantly detect more metabolites in biological samples, and is more accurate and sensitive for metabolite identifications. The MetDIA program and the metabolite spectral library is freely available on the Internet.},

abstract = {In the hierarchy of data, information and knowledge, computational methods play a major role in the initial processing of data to extract information, but they alone become less effective to compile knowledge from information. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) resource (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) has been developed as a reference knowledge base to assist this latter process. In particular, the KEGG pathway maps are widely used for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. The link from genomes to pathways is made through the KEGG Orthology system, a collection of manually defined ortholog groups identified by K numbers. To better automate this interpretation process the KEGG modules defined by Boolean expressions of K numbers have been expanded and improved. Once genes in a genome are annotated with K numbers, the KEGG modules can be computationally evaluated revealing metabolic capacities and other phenotypic features. The reaction modules, which represent chemical units of reactions, have been used to analyze design principles of metabolic networks and also to improve the definition of K numbers and associated annotations. For translational bioinformatics, the KEGG MEDICUS resource has been developed by integrating drug labels (package inserts) used in society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 David et al.Background: Disturbance to human microbiota may underlie several pathologies. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how lifestyle affects the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities. Results: Here, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of human wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each subjects' life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, the dynamics of select microbial taxa could be associated with specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake positively correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15{\%} of gut microbiota members. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major cause of death since ancient time documented in Egyptian Ptolemaic mummy imaging. PCa detection is critical to personalized medicine and varies considerably under an MRI scan. 172 patients with 2,602 morphologic images (axial 2D T2-weighted imaging) of the prostate were obtained. A deep learning with deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a non-deep learning with SIFT image feature and bag-of-word (BoW), a representative method for image recognition and analysis, were used to distinguish pathologically confirmed PCa patients from prostate benign conditions (BCs) patients with prostatitis or prostate benign hyperplasia (BPH). In fully automated detection of PCa patients, deep learning had a statistically higher area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) than non-deep learning (P = 0.0007 {\textless} 0.001). The AUCs were 0.84 (95{\%} CI 0.78-0.89) for deep learning method and 0.70 (95{\%} CI 0.63-0.77) for non-deep learning method, respectively. Our results suggest that deep learning with DCNN is superior to non-deep learning with SIFT image feature and BoW model for fully automated PCa patients differentiation from prostate BCs patients. Our deep learning method is extensible to image modalities such as MR imaging, CT and PET of other organs.},

abstract = {Importance Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation. Objective To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. Design and Setting A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency. Exposure Deep learning-trained algorithm. Main Outcomes and Measures The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity. Results The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2{\%} women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8{\%}]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6{\%} women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6{\%}]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95{\%} CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95{\%} CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 87.5{\%}-92.7{\%}) and the specificity was 98.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 97.8{\%}-98.5{\%}). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 81.1{\%}-91.0{\%}) and the specificity was 98.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 97.7{\%}-99.1{\%}). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5{\%} and specificity was 93.4{\%} and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1{\%} and specificity was 93.9{\%}. Conclusions and Relevance In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The recent advances in metabolomics have created the potential to measure the levels of hundreds of metabolites which are the end products of cellular regulatory processes. The automation of the sample acquisition and subsequent analysis in high-throughput instruments that are capable of measuring metabolites is posing a challenge on the necessary systematic storage and computational processing of the experimental datasets. Whereas a multitude of specialized software systems for individual instruments and preprocessing methods exists, there is clearly a need for a free and platform-independent system that allows the standardized and integrated storage and analysis of data obtained from metabolomics experiments. Currently there exists no such system that on the one hand supports preprocessing of raw datasets but also allows to visualize and integrate the results of higher level statistical analyses within a functional genomics context. RESULTS To facilitate the systematic storage, analysis and integration of metabolomics experiments, we have implemented MeltDB, a web-based software platform for the analysis and annotation of datasets from metabolomics experiments. MeltDB supports open file formats (netCDF, mzXML, mzDATA) and facilitates the integration and evaluation of existing preprocessing methods. The system provides researchers with means to consistently describe and store their experimental datasets. Comprehensive analysis and visualization features of metabolomics datasets are offered to the community through a web-based user interface. The system covers the process from raw data to the visualization of results in a knowledge-based background and is integrated into the context of existing software platforms of genomics and transcriptomics at Bielefeld University. We demonstrate the potential of MeltDB by means of a sample experiment where we dissect the influence of three different carbon sources on the gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris on the level of measured metabolites. Experimental data are stored, analyzed and annotated within MeltDB and accessible via the public MeltDB web server. AVAILABILITY The system is publicly available at http://meltdb.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de.},

Here we report the human gut microbial composition in a population sample of 123 non-obese and 169 obese Danish individuals. We find two groups of individuals that differ by the number of gut microbial genes and thus gut bacterial richness. They contain known and previously unknown bacterial species at different proportions; individuals with a low bacterial richness (23{\%} of the population) are characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia and a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype when compared with high bacterial richness individuals. The obese individuals among the lower bacterial richness group also gain more weight over time. Only a few bacterial species are sufficient to distinguish between individuals with high and low bacterial richness, and even between lean and obese participants. Our classifications based on variation in the gut microbiome identify subsets of individuals in the general white adult population who may be at increased risk of progressing to adiposity-associated co-morbidities.},

Among women with spontaneous preterm birth, cervical length of 25 mm or less occurred in 35 of 439 (8.0{\%}) at 16 to 22 weeks' gestation and in 94 of 403 (23.3{\%}) at 22 to 30 weeks' gestation.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for screening between 22 and 30 weeks for fetal fibronectin level alone was 0.59 (95{\%} CI, 0.56-0.62), for transvaginal cervical length alone was 0.67 (95{\%} CI, 0.64-0.70), and for the combination as continuous variables was 0.67 (95{\%} CI, 0.64-0.70).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Among nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies, quantitative vaginal fetal fibronectin and serial transvaginal ultrasound cervical length had low predictive accuracy for spontaneous preterm birth.

abstract = {We present a new update to MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0) for comprehensive metabolomic data analysis, interpretation, and integration with other omics data. Since the last major update in 2015, MetaboAnalyst has continued to evolve based on user feedback and technological advancements in the field. For this year's update, four newkey features have been added to MetaboAnalyst 4.0, including: (1) real-time R com- mand tracking and display coupled with the release of a companion P way activity from untargeted mass spectral data us- anal ing the eakstoP package; (2) a a ys module for prediction of path- ystR ysis m u module for robust biomarker identification mmic thwa hog MetaboAnal algorithm; (3) a Biomarker MS Meta- through the combination of multiple metabolomic datasets and (4) a Netw ork E tegrative analysis of metabolomics, metagenomics, xplorer module for in- and/or transcriptomics data. The user interface of MetaboAnalyst 4.0 has been reengineered to provide a more modern look and feel, as well as to give more space and flexibility to introduce new func- tions. The underlying knowledgebases (compound libraries, metabolite sets, and metabolic pathways) have also been updated based on the latest data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). A Docker image of MetaboAnalyst is also available to facilitate download and local installation of Metabo- Analyst.MetaboAnalyst 4.0 is freely available at http: //metaboanalyst.ca},

@article{Zeevi2015,
abstract = {Summary Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. Video Abstract},

@article{Cambiaghi2016,
abstract = {Metabolomics is a rapidly growing field consisting of the analysis of a large number of metabolites at a system scale. The two major goals of metabolomics are the identification of the metabolites characterizing each organism state and the measurement of their dynamics under different situations (e.g. pathological conditions, environmental factors). Knowledge about metabolites is crucial for the understanding of most cellular phenomena, but this information alone is not sufficient to gain a comprehensive view of all the biological processes involved. Integrated approaches combining metabolomics with transcriptomics and proteomics are thus required to obtain much deeper insights than any of these techniques alone. Although this information is available, multilevel integration of different 'omics' data is still a challenge. The handling, processing, analysis and integration of these data require specialized mathematical, statistical and bioinformatics tools, and several technical problems hampering a rapid progress in the field exist. Here, we review four main tools for number of users or provided features (MetaCore TM , MetaboAnalyst, InCroMAP and 3Omics) out of the several available for metabolomic data analysis and integration with other 'omics' data, highlighting their strong and weak aspects; a number of related issues affecting data analysis and integration are also identified and discussed. Overall, we provide an objective description of how some of the main currently available software packages work, which may help the experimental practitioner in the choice of a robust pipeline for metabolomic data analysis and integration.},
